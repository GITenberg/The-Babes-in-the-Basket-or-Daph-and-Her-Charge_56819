<span class="font">The Moonlight Visitor.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evening air stole gently into a
quiet room in a southern island, more
than sixty years ago.</p>

<p>There were no casements in the wide
windows; the heavy shutters were
thrown back, and the moonlight poured,
in long, unbroken streams, across
the polished, un-carpeted floor.</p>

<p>Within the large pleasant room, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
children were sleeping in their curtained
beds, like birds in pretty cages.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a cautious tread
in the hall, and then a strange figure
stood silently in the moonlight. Without
candle, or taper, might have been plainly
seen the short, strongly-built woman,
whose black face and gay turban formed
a striking contrast to the fair children
in their loose, white night-dresses.</p>

<p>Who was that dark intruder, and
what was her secret errand, in that
quiet room?</p>

<p>It was Daph, black Daph, and when
you have heard more about her, you
can better judge whether she came as
a friend, or an enemy, to the sleeping
children of her master.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>The large mirror, bright in the moonlight,
seemed to have an irresistible
attraction for the negro, and the sight
of her black face fully reflected there,
made her show her white teeth in a
grin of decided approval. The pleased
expression, however, disappeared almost
instantly, as she said impatiently,
&#8220;Foolish darky, spendin dese precious
time, looking at your own ugly face!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this whispered exclamation, the
children stirred uneasily. &#8220;If I mus,
I mus!&#8221; said Daph, resolutely, as she
drew from her pocket a box, containing
two small pills. With the pills in
her hand she approached the bedside
of the little girl, who was now half
sitting up, and looking at Daph, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the bewildered expression of one suddenly
aroused from sleep.</p>

<p>Daph put aside the mosquito bar,
and said, coaxingly, &#8220;Take dis, Miss
Lou, quick as you can, and don&#8217;t go
for waking Mass Charley, asleep da in
dat beauty bed of his.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph had slipped the pill into a
juicy bit of pineapple, which she seemed
to have had ready for the purpose,
and the child instantly swallowed it.
With one trustful, pleasant glance from
her large, blue eyes, the fair-haired
little girl sank back on her pillow,
and was soon in the sweet sleep of innocence.</p>

<p>As soon as Daph saw the small,
slender hands lie open and relaxed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
she closed the gauze-like curtains, and
stole to the cradle-bed of the little
boy. She raised his head gently on
her arm, and placed in his mouth a bit
of the same juicy fruit she had given
his sister, containing another of those
hidden pills, which she seemed so anxious
to administer. The child did not
wake, but the sweet morsel was pleasant
to his taste, and no doubt mingled
in his baby-dreams of the joys of the
pleasant world in which he had passed
but little more than a twelve month.</p>

<p>Daph now set to work busily to fill
a huge basket, which she brought from
some place of deposit near at hand.
The drawers of the bureau, and the
contents of the elegant dressing-case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
she thoroughly over-hauled, making
such selections as seemed to please
her fancy, and being withal somewhat
dainty in her choice. Children&#8217;s clothing,
of the finest and best, formed the
lowest layer in the basket; then followed
a sprinkling of rings and necklaces,
interspersed with the choice furniture
of the rich dressing-case. Over all
was placed a large light shawl, with its
many soft folds, and then Daph viewed
the success of her packing with much
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Quietly and stealthily she approached
the bed, where the little girl was
sleeping so soundly that she did not
wake, even when Daph lifted her in
her strong arms, and laid her gently in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the great basket,&mdash;the choicest treasure
of all. In another moment the plump,
rosy boy was lying with his fairy-like
sister, in that strange resting-place.
Daph looked at them, as they lay side
by side, and a tear rolled over her dark
cheeks, and, as it fell, sparkled in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>The negro had taken up a white
cloth, and was in the act of throwing
it over the basket, when a small book,
with golden clasps, suddenly caught
her eye; rolling it quickly in a soft,
rich veil, she placed it between the
children, and her task was done.</p>

<p>It was but the work of a moment,
to fasten on the cloth-covering with a
stout string; then, with one strong effort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Daph stooped, took the basket on
her head, and went forth from the door
with as stately a step as if she wore a
crown.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II.<br />

<span class="font">The &#8220;Martha Jane.&#8221;</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was the bustle of departure,
on board a Yankee schooner, which
some hope of gain had brought to the
southern island, named in our last
chapter. The fresh and favorable
breeze hurried the preparations of the
sailors, as they moved about full of
glad thoughts of return to their distant
home.</p>

<p>The boat, which had been sent ashore
for some needful supplies, was
fast approaching the vessel, and in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
among the rough tars, was Daph, her
precious basket at her side, and her
bright eyes passing from face to face,
with an eager, wistful glance, that
seemed trying to read the secrets of
each heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here! go-a-head, woman! I&#8217;ll
hand up your chickens;&#8221; said one of
the sailors, as they reached the anchored
schooner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I keeps my chickens to myself,&#8221;
said Daph, as she placed the basket on
her head, and went up the side of the
vessel, as steadily and securely as the
oldest tar of all.</p>

<p>As soon as she set her foot on deck,
the sailors thronged around her, offering
to take her chickens from her, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
her own price, and passing their rough
jokes on her stout figure and shining
black face. One young sailor, bolder
than the rest, laid his hand on the
basket, and had well-nigh torn away
its cover. The joke might have proved
a dangerous one for him. A blow from
Daph&#8217;s strong arm sent him staggering
backwards, and in another moment,
the negress had seized an oar, and was
brandishing it round her head, threatening
with destruction any one who
should dare to touch her property, and
declaring that with the captain, and
with him alone, would she treat for
the chickens, about which so much had
been said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cap&#8217;in,&#8221; said she, as a tall, firmly-knit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
man drew near the scene of the
disturbance; &#8220;Cap&#8217;in, it&#8217;s you, sah, I
wants to speak wid, and just you by
yourself, away from these fellows, who
don&#8217;t know how to treat a &#8217;spectable
darkie, who belongs to the greatest
gentleman in the island. Let me see
you in your little cubby there, and if
you have an heart in you, we&#8217;ll make
a bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something so earnest in
the woman&#8217;s manner, that Captain
Jones at once consented to her odd
request, smiling at himself as he did
so.</p>

<p>A kind of temporary cabin had been
put up on deck, for the protection of
the captain from the hot rays of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
southern sun. It was but a rude
frame-work, covered with sail-cloth,
and yet, when the canvas door was
closed, it formed a pleasant and cool
place of retirement for an afternoon
nap, or for the transaction of private
business.</p>

<p>To that spot Daph followed the
captain, her basket on her head, and
her firm step and consequential air
seeming to say to the sailors,&mdash;&#8220;You
see, your captain knows better than
you do how to treat such a person as
I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they were once within the
little enclosure, Daph&#8217;s manner changed.
She put down her precious basket,
and looking the captain directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in the eye, she said, solemnly, &#8220;Cap&#8217;in,
would you see a man struggle for his
life in de deep water, outside da, and
nebber lift your hand to save him?
Would you see a house on fire, and
sweet baby-children burning in it, and
just look on to see de awsome blaze,
and nebber stir to save de dear babies?
Cap&#8217;in, I&#8217;se brought you a good work
to do. Dey say de great Lord blesses
dem dat cares for little children, and
gives dem a good seat in heaven.
Swear by de great Lord you wont tell
de dreadsome secret I&#8217;se going to tell
you! Swear! time is short!&#8221;</p>

<p>The kind-hearted captain was impressed
by the earnest manner of the
woman, and not a little curious to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
hear the secret that seemed to fill her
with such strong feeling; &#8220;I swear,&#8221;
said he, simply, &#8220;go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De darkies in dis island,&#8221; said
Daph, slowly, &#8220;de darkies are crazy
for de blood of der masters. Poor,
wicked fools! Dey means to have
enough of it to-night! By to-morrow
morning, de white faces on dis coast
will ebery one be white wid de death-whiteness!
Old folks and little children&mdash;dey
mean to kill dem all! Dey
told Daph deir secret, as if dey thought
she was all black, inside and out. De
Lord forgib Daph, dat she did not
strike dem down, where dey stood
shewing deir teeth, at the thought of
living in master&#8217;s house, and he cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in de grave! Dear massa and missus
are up in de country, and Daph could
n&#8217;t get word to dem, but something in
here said, &#8216;You can save the sweet
babies, Daph;&#8217; so I made as if I was
ready to kill dose I loves de best, and
set to work a-contriving how a poor,
foolish darky could save dose sweet
lambs. Your men was always glad to
take Daph&#8217;s chickens, and so de way
seemed open. I&#8217;se put my darlings in
de basket, and here dey are for you to
take care ob for de Lord, and he&#8217;ll
reckon wid you for it. It aint likely
dey&#8217;ll have any friends to stand by em,
and thank ye for it, &#8217;cept one poor
darky, named Daph!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a twinkling, Daph had torn off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the cover of the basket, and there lay
the sleeping children; calm and still
as if on their mother&#8217;s bosom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey do breave, de sweet dears!&#8221;
said Daph, as she bent tenderly over
them.</p>

<p>Great tears fell from the eyes of
honest Captain Jones. He was an old
sailor, but to salt water in this form he
had long been a stranger. He tried to
speak, but the voice that had been
heard above the tumult of many a
storm, was now choked and husky.
In an instant he regained his self-command,
and said, &#8220;You have found the
right man, Daph! No harm shall
come to them so long as my name is
Jeremiah Jones! The Martha Jane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
can skim the water like a wild duck,
and will be off towards a better
country before ten minutes are
over!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of Captain
Jones&#8217;s mouth, before he left his
tent-like cabin, and in a moment he
was heard giving orders for instant departure.</p>

<p>The energy that had borne Daph
through her hour of trial, seemed to
desert her, now that her object was
attained, and she sank down beside the
little ones, sobbing like a child. She
felt herself a poor, helpless, ignorant
creature, going she knew not whither,
and having assumed a charge she knew
not how to fulfil.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>&#8220;De great Lord, dat missus loves,
can take care of us!&#8221; thought the
humble negro; &#8220;He can give poor
Daph sense to mind de babies!&#8221;</p>

<p>In her ignorance, she knew not how
to pray, but she leaned in simple faith
upon the only source of strength, and
found consolation.</p>

<p>In a half-hour after the arrival of
Daph on board the Martha Jane, the
trim little vessel was speeding on her
homeward course.</p>

<p>Captain Jones walked the deck in
deep meditation, while from their various
positions his crew watched him
with curious glances. The sailors well
knew that Daph was still on board,
but no one had dared to question the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
captain&#8217;s orders for putting instantly
out to sea.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Jones was a thorough republican,
when at home in good old
Massachusetts; but once on board the
Martha Jane, he ruled with the despotic
power of the Emperor of all the Russias.
His crew were accustomed to
submission, and murmuring was never
heard among them. They had indeed
no cause for discontent, for Captain
Jones was just, kind-hearted, and high-principled,
and he wisely ruled his
little realm.</p>

<p>The good captain had acted upon a
sudden impulse, for promptness was
required, but now came a time for
sober reflection.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&#8220;If the darky has not told the
truth;&#8221; so reasoned he; &#8220;what has
Jeremiah Jones been doing? He has
kidnapped a valuable servant and carried
off two children, belonging to a
man who has the power and wealth to
make said Jeremiah suffer for his madness.
The thing has been done publicly,
and these fellows of mine may
think it for their interest to deliver
me up, as soon as I set foot in old
Boston!&#8221;</p>

<p>These meditations did not seem to
increase the peace of mind of the
worthy New Englander. He walked
the deck impatiently for a few minutes,
and then drew near the objects of his
anxious thought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>He put aside the canvas curtain,
and stood for a moment in the clear
moonlight, watching the sleepers.
Daph had thrown her arm protectingly
round the basket, and curled about it,
as if conscious of her charge, even in
the deep slumber into which she had
fallen. That long, earnest look set the
perturbed mind of the captain at rest,
and again the unwonted tears filled his
large, gray eyes.</p>

<p>A state of indecision could not last
long in such a mind as that of Captain
Jones, and his usually prompt, authoritative
manner suddenly returned to
him. He seized a trumpet, and gave
a shout of &#8220;all hands on deck,&#8221; which
soon brought his eager crew about him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>In a few words he told Daph&#8217;s fearful
story, and then throwing aside the
awning, he exposed to view the sleeping
forms of the negro and the little
ones, as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have pledged myself to be a
friend to those whom God has sent me
to take care of, my men, but if there
is one among you who doubts that
faithful creature&#8217;s story, or who is
afraid to lend a hand to save those
sweet throats from the murdering
knives of those black rascals on shore,
let him stand out here, and speak for
himself. Let him take a boat, and put
out for the island, while it is yet in
sight. We don&#8217;t want him here. He
shall have his wages, and bounty too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
for the master he serves is likely to
give him little comfort in the long run.
Speak out, men, will you stand by me,
or will you go ashore?&#8221;</p>

<p>Every voice joined in the hearty
cheer with which the captain&#8217;s words
were received. Rough hands were
stretched out towards him, and he responded
to their warm grasp with a
hearty shake, as one by one the men
came up to give him this token of their
determination to help him, in the good
deed he had begun.</p>

<p>The cheer that was so welcome to
the ear of Captain Jones had quite a
different effect upon poor Daph. She
sprang to her feet in wild alarm, and
placing herself in front of her darlings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
stood ready to do battle in their behalf.</p>

<p>The men drew back, and Captain
Jones hastened to explain to Daph the
hearty expression of good-will towards
her, which had risen spontaneously
from the crew of the Martha Jane.</p>

<p>Daph&#8217;s apprehensions were soon
quieted, and, at the suggestion of the
captain, she prepared to remove her
darlings from their strange resting-place
to one of the small state-rooms
below.</p>

<p>The children did not wake while she
laid them gently in the berth, and
stretched herself beside them on the
floor. Daph began to be troubled at
the soundness of their long-continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
sleep. She raised herself, and crouching
near them, she watched them with
ever-increasing uneasiness.</p>

<p>Captain Jones was on deck, giving a
last look to see that all was right, before
retiring for the night, when Daph
came hastily up to him, and laying her
hand beseechingly on his arm, she
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;O! Cap&#8217;in! I&#8217;se a-feard I&#8217;se just
killed my pretty ones! dey do sleep
so. Dem was such little pills, dey
didn&#8217;t seem as if dey could be so mighty
powersome!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pills!&#8221; said the captain, with a
start; &#8220;what have you given them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I jus don&#8217;t know myself,&#8221; said
Daph, desperately. &#8220;Daph had de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
ear-ache mighty bad last week, and
missus, dear creeter&mdash;she was always
so kind&mdash;she gibs me two little pills,
and she says, &#8216;here Daph, you take
dese when you goes to bed, and you
will sleep so sound, de pain will all go
way!&#8217; I says, &#8216;tank&#8217;ee missus,&#8217; of
course, and she goes up to de house
quite satisfied. Daph nebber did take
no doctor&#8217;s stuff, so I puts de little
pills in my pocket, and just roasts an
orange soft, and ties it warm outside
my ear, and goes to bed, and sleeps
like a lizard. Now when I thinks of
putting de children in de basket, something
says to me, &#8216;you gib dem dose
little pills, Daph, dey&#8217;ll make &#8217;em sleep
sound &#8217;nough.&#8217; So, I&#8217;se just did like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
poor, foolish darky.&#8221; Here Daph began
to cry piteously.</p>

<p>Captain Jones went immediately to
the cabin. The natural color and
healthy breathing of the little sleepers
soon assured him that all was right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Courage! old girl!&#8221; said the captain,
cheerily, &#8220;turn in yourself, and
I&#8217;ll warrant you the youngsters will be
none the worse for your doctoring!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus consoled, Daph lay down again
beside her charge, and the silence of
deep sleep soon prevailed, not only in
the little state-room, but throughout
the Martha Jane, save when the measured
steps of the watch sounded out
through the stillness of the night.</p>

<span class="font">The Water-Lily.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> sunrise the morning after she set
sail, the &#8220;Martha Jane&#8221; was dancing
over the waves, far out of sight of
mainland or island.</p>

<p>Daph was an early riser, and in the
gray dawn she bestirred herself with
her usual waking thought&mdash;&#8220;This is a
busy world, and Daph must be up and
at work.&#8221; Her first glance around
showed her that she was not in the
southern kitchen, which had so long
been her domain, and a merry sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
near her reminded her of the new
duties she had undertaken.</p>

<p>Charlie was sitting up in the berth,
his bright black eyes sparkling with
delight at the new scene in which he
found himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty! pretty little bed!&#8221; were
the first words that met Daph&#8217;s ear.
The hearty hug with which she responded
to this pleasant greeting, and
the consequent laugh of the child,
roused his fair sister.</p>

<p>Louise started up, and looked wildly
around her; &#8220;Where are we, Daffy,&#8221;
she asked, anxiously. &#8220;We&#8217;s just on
board a beauty ship, a-going to see
pretty countries over the water,&#8221; said
Daph, coaxingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>&#8220;But why do we go?&#8221; urged the
child, by no means satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cause, cause,&#8221; said Daph, &#8220;cause
de great Lord tinks it best.&#8221;</p>

<p>The face of little Louise instantly
took a sobered and submissive expression,
and she said quietly, &#8220;Well,
Daffy, Lou will try to be a good girl;
where&#8217;s Dinah?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;se to be nurse now, Miss Lou,&#8221;
answered Daph, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how nice! No cross Dinah
any more!&#8221; exclaimed the little girl,
clapping her hands with very great
delight.</p>

<p>Charlie thought proper to clap his
hands, too, and to cry out, boisterously,
&#8220;Caky! caky!&#8221;&mdash;a cry which Daph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
well understood, and for which she
was amply prepared.</p>

<p>She drew from one of her huge
pockets some cakes for the children,
and then they all three began to chat
as pleasantly as if they were at their
favorite resort, under the old tree
that grew in front of Daph&#8217;s southern
kitchen.</p>

<p>Daph found it a difficult business to
dress her young master and mistress,
but Louise was a helpful little creature,
and was of great assistance in enabling
the new nurse to select the suitable
garments, from the store that had been
hastily thrust into the great basket.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to comb
Louise&#8217;s soft, straight golden hair off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
her fair forehead, but it was another
thing to deal with master Charlie&#8217;s
mop of short, chestnut curls. The
new bond between Daph and the sturdy
boy had well nigh been broken, by the
smart pulls she gave, in the course of
her unskilful efforts.</p>

<p>When Captain Jones came into the
cabin after his usual round on deck, in
the morning, he was greeted by the
sound of merry young voices, which
struck strangely on his ear.</p>

<p>Daph gave one peep from the state-room,
to be sure who was near at
hand, and then leading out the children,
she bade them &#8220;go right to the
very kindest gentleman that anybody
ever had for a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>Charlie put out his arms towards the
honest captain, who took the little
fellow warmly to his heart.</p>

<p>Louise held on to Daph&#8217;s apron with
one hand, and the other she put out
timidly towards her new friend.</p>

<p>That small, soft, gentle hand was
placed in the hard, dark palm of the
captain, quietly as a flower might fall
on a wayside path. Captain Jones
bent tenderly down to the fair, slender
child, and kissed her smooth forehead.
She loosened her hold of Daph, and
nestled at his side. Again those
stranger-tears filled the captain&#8217;s eyes,
but he did not look the worse for
them, or for the kindly smile that
beamed from his frank, sun-burnt face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>An odd looking party sat round
the breakfast-table, in the cabin, that
morning. Captain Jones was at the
head, with Charlie on his knee; opposite
him was perched the little Louise,
while the weather-browned faces of
the mates appeared at the sides.</p>

<p>Daph had claimed the privilege of
milking &#8220;Passenger,&#8221; the cow&mdash;which
Captain Jones had taken with him on
many voyages, and on which he had
lavished much of the surplus affection
of his bachelor-heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Passenger,&#8221; would have found out
that she had powerful rivals, if she
could have seen Charlie, enjoying his
cup of fresh milk on the captain&#8217;s
knee, and Louise looking at him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
mild trustful glances, that went right
to his heart.</p>

<p>Daph saw all this, if &#8220;Passenger&#8221;
did not, and with her white teeth in
full sight she moved round the table,
in the position of waiter, which she
had assumed to keep her darlings in
view, and to have a care that their
new friends, in their abundant kindness,
did not feed them too freely with
sailor&#8217;s fare.</p>

<p>That was a happy day to the children&mdash;that
first day on board the
&#8220;Martha Jane,&#8221;&mdash;and the captain prophesied
that Charlie would &#8220;stand
the sea like an old salt,&#8221; and Louise
would be as much at home on it as
the &#8220;Martha Jane&#8221; herself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>There had been a fresh breeze all
day, but towards evening the wind
grew stronger, and Daph would have
found it hard to carry even a trifle on
that head of hers, which had so steadily
borne many a heavy burden. She
began also to experience certain
strange internal sensations, for which
she could not account; but the faithful
creature bore up without a complaint,
though she staggered to and
fro in a way which made the rough
sailors laugh merrily at her expense.</p>

<p>Poor Daph! Such sufferings as hers
could not long be kept secret. Through
the live-long night she lay in the anguish
of sea-sickness, which can only
be appreciated by those who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
experienced its miseries. In her ignorance,
she supposed herself to have
been seized by some fearful malady,
which must soon take her life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daph would be glad to die, she so
awsome sick,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;but
den, who will mind de babies? No,
no! Daph wont die yet. De great
Lord wont let her; Daph knows he
wont!&#8221;</p>

<p>For two days the poor negro wrestled
mightily against the horrors of
sea-sickness, bearing up with the motive,
&#8220;Daph must live for de babies!&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Jones had all
the charge of his new pets. &#8220;Passenger&#8221;
was quite forgotten, as the stout
sailor walked the deck, with Charlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
peeping out from under his rough
overcoat, and Louise walking at his
side, wrapped in the long soft shawl
that Daph had stowed away in that
wonderful basket.</p>

<p>They had strange talks together&mdash;that
strong man and those prattling
children&mdash;and they learned much from
each other. He told of the wonders
of the sea&mdash;the great whales and the
floating ice-bergs&mdash;and the petrel, that
the sailor never kills. Many long
years, Captain Jones had made the sea
his home, and much he knew, which
books had never taught him, yet in
little more than three short years,
Louise had caught a priceless secret,
which he had never found in any land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
He was familiar with the wonders of
nature, but to her the Great Creator,
to whom he was a stranger, was as
a familiar, trusted friend. The marvels
which Captain Jones could tell of the
ocean, but increased her wonder at His
power, who &#8220;made the heavens, the
earth, the sea, and all that in them is,&#8221;
and in her simple way she would
&#8220;praise the Lord for all his wonderful
works.&#8221; Charlie little knew of the
strong feelings which agitated the
breast to which he was clasped, while
his little sister lisped of the lessons
learned at her mother&#8217;s knee.</p>

<p>Those days of Daph&#8217;s sickness were
precious days to Captain Jones, and he
was almost sorry when the stout negro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
triumphed over her enemy, and came
on deck to resume her charge.</p>

<p>The air grew chill as the &#8220;Martha
Jane&#8221; sped on her northward course,
and the white dresses of the children
fluttered, most unseasonably, in the
cool breeze. The ship&#8217;s stores were
ransacked for some material, of which
to make them more suitable, though
extempore clothing. A roll of red
flannel was all that promised to answer
the purpose. The captain took the
place of master-workman, and cut out
what he called &#8220;a handsome suit for a
pair of sea-birds;&#8221; and Daph, with
her clumsy fingers, made the odd garments.
She felt ready to cry as she
put them on, to see her pets so disfigured;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
but Captain Jones laughed at
her dolorous face, and said the red
frock only made his &#8220;lily&#8221; look the
fairer, and turned Charlie into the
sailor he should be.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Martha Jane&#8221; was nearing
the familiar waters of her own northern
home, when the Captain called
Daph into the cabin, one evening, to consult
with her on matters of importance.</p>

<p>With the happy disposition of the
negro, Daph seemed to have forgotten
that she was not always to live on
board the &#8220;Martha Jane,&#8221; and under
the kind protection of her sailor-friend;
she was, therefore, not a little startled,
when he addressed to her the blunt
question:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>&#8220;Where are you going, Daph?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, Daph had a most indistinct
idea of the world at large, but, thus
brought suddenly to a decision, she
promptly named the only northern
city of which she had heard. &#8220;I&#8217;se
going to New York,&#8221; she said; &#8220;Miss
Elize, my dear missus, was born dere,
and it seems de right sort of a place to
be takin de sweet babies to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Daph,&#8221; said the honest captain,
&#8220;we shall put in to New York to-morrow,
for I have freight to land
there, but you had better go on with
me to old Boston. There I can look
after you a little, and put you under
charge of my good mother; and a
better woman never trod shoe-leather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
for all her son is none of the best.
Shall it be so, Daph?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could n&#8217;t do it! Massa Cap&#8217;in.
Boston! dat mus be mighty far off. I
nebber hear tell of such a place. New
York&#8217;s de home for my babies, just
where missus was born. May be, some
ob her grand cousins may be turnin up
da, to be friends to de pretty dears.
Nobody would eber find us, way off in
Boston!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in vain that the captain tried
to change Daph&#8217;s resolution; to New
York she would go, and he now attacked
her at another point, asking,
&#8220;What are you going to do when you
get there, Daph? Have you got any
money?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>&#8220;Not so berry much to begin wid,&#8221;
said Daph, producing a bit of rag from
her pocket, in which some small change,
the result of her traffic in chickens,
was stored. &#8220;Not much money, Massa
Cap&#8217;in, as you see for yeself; but what
do you tink ob dese?&#8221; Daph loosened
her dress, and showed on her black
neck several gold chains, hung with
rings of great richness and value, and
an old-fashioned necklace, set with
precious stones. &#8220;What do you tink
ob dese, Massa Cap&#8217;in?&#8221; she repeated,
as she displayed her treasures to his
astonished sight.</p>

<p>Daph had put her valuables on for
safe-keeping, doubtless, yet not without
a certain satisfaction in wearing articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
which so gratified the love of finery
common to the black race.</p>

<p>The captain looked at the jewelry
with a sober, pitying expression, as he
said, compassionately, &#8220;Poor Daph!
If you should offer one of those rich
chains for sale in New York, you might
be hurried off to jail as a thief, in a
twinkling; then what would become
of my pets?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph betook herself to tears for a
few moments, and then rallied, and
said, stoutly, &#8220;Daph can work for de
babies. She&#8217;s a strong darky. Heard
massa say many a time, Daph would
bring a big price. Daph will make
heaps of money, and keep young
massa and missus libbing like great
folks, as dey should.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>At this idea, Daph&#8217;s face regained
all its usual cheerfulness, and she could
not be shaken by the further doubts and
fears brought forward by Captain Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep what you have round your
neck safely then, Daph,&#8221; said the
honest sailor, &#8220;and never try to sell
them, unless you are ready to starve.
Here&#8217;s a little purse of solid gold, that
I meant as a present for my mother;
she, good soul, would rather you had
it, I know. This will keep you till
you can get a start, and then, may be,
you can work for the dear children, as
you say. I have an acquaintance in
New York, who may let you a room
or two, and if she can take you in,
you may get along.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>&#8220;I knew de great Lord would look
out for us. His name be praised!&#8221;
said the poor negro, gratefully, as she
kissed the hand of Captain Jones.
&#8220;Ye wont lose your reward, Massa
Cap&#8217;in; He&#8217;ll reckon wid ye!&#8221; and
she pointed reverently upwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;May He reckon with me in mercy,
and not count up my sins!&#8221; the captain
said, solemnly, and then bade
Daph &#8220;good-night.&#8221;</p>

<span class="font">The Red House with the Blue Shutters.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Captain Jones</span> was a prompt and
upright business-man, faithful to his
engagements, at any sacrifice.</p>

<p>He was pledged to remain in New
York the shortest possible space of
time, he therefore had not, after attending
to necessary business, even an
hour to devote to Daph and the little
ones. It was a sad moment to him,
when he strained Charlie to his breast
for the last time, and kissed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
&#8220;Water-lily,&#8221; as he loved to call
Louise.</p>

<p>He had given Daph a letter to a
sailor&#8217;s widow, with whom he thought
she would be able to secure a home,
where she would escape the idle and
vicious poor who congregated in less
respectable parts of the city. After
having made Daph count on her fingers,
half a dozen times, the number
of streets she must cross before she
came to &#8220;the small red house, with
blue shutters,&#8221; where she was to stop,
he piloted the little party into Broadway,
and setting their faces in the
right direction, he bade them an
affectionate farewell.</p>

<p>As he shook Daph&#8217;s black hand for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the last time, she placed in his a small
parcel, clumsily tied up in brown
paper, saying, &#8220;You puts that in your
pocket, Massa Cap&#8217;in, and when you
gets to sea, you open it, and you will
understand what Daph means.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Jones did, almost unconsciously,
as Daph suggested, as, with a
full heart, he turned away from the
little ones who had become so dear to
him.</p>

<p>Once more, the only protector of
her master&#8217;s children, Daph&#8217;s energy
seemed to return to her. She wound
the shawl more closely about Louise,
drew Charlie to her honest bosom,
looked after the various bundles, and
then set off at a regular marching pace.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>The strange appearance of the little
party, soon attracted the attention of
the knots of idle boys, who even then
infested the more populous parts of
New York.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo, Darky! where&#8217;s your hand-organ?
What&#8217;ll ye take for your
monkeys?&#8221; shouted one of these young
rascals, as he eyed the children in
their odd-looking red flannel garments.</p>

<p>Louise clung closely to Daph, who
strode steadily on, apparently unconscious
of the little troop gathering in
her rear. By degrees the young
scamps drew nearer to her, and one
of them, taking hold of the skirt of
her dress, cried out, &#8220;Come, fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
form a line! Follow the captain, and
do as you see me do!&#8221;</p>

<p>A long string of boys arranged
themselves behind Daph, each holding
on to the other&#8217;s tattered garments,
and walking with mock solemnity,
while the foremost shouted in Daph&#8217;s
ear the most provoking and impudent
things his imagination and rascality
could suggest.</p>

<p>Daph maintained her apparent unconsciousness
until she came in front
of a large door, with a deep recess,
which opened directly on the street,
and but a step above the pavement.</p>

<p>With a sudden and unexpected jerk
she freed herself from her tormentor,
then placing Charlie and Louise for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
moment in the recess, she charged
upon her assailants. Right and left
she dealt hearty slaps, with her open
hand, which sent the little crew howling
away, their cheeks smarting with
pain and burning with rage. The
whole thing was the work of a moment.
Daph took Charlie in her
arms, clasped the trembling hand of
Louise, and resumed her steady walk
as calmly as if nothing had occurred.</p>

<p>There was much to attract the attention
of the strangers in the new scenes
about them, but Daph kept her head
straight forward, and devoted all her
attention to numbering the corners she
passed, that she might know when to
begin to look out for the house so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
carefully described by good Captain
Jones.</p>

<p>Louise soon grew weary of keeping
pace with Daph&#8217;s long strides, and the
faithful negro lifted the little girl in
her arms, and went patiently on with
her double burden.</p>

<p>A weary, weary walk it seemed,
even to the strong-limbed negro, before
they passed the last corner, according
to her reckoning, and stood in
front of the very red house with blue
shutters which she had been so anxious
to see. Much as she had longed to
reach it, its appearance did not fill
Daph&#8217;s heart with joy. A sort of
dread of the new people whom she
was to meet stole over her, but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
resolved to put a bold face on the
matter, and in this mood she gave a
heavy knock at the blue door. Her
imperative summons was promptly
answered.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a little girl,
of about ten years of age, who was
covered, from her slender neck to her
bare feet, with a long checked pinafore,
above which appeared a closely-cropped,
brown head, and a small,
demure-looking face. The child stood
perfectly still, gazing in quiet wonder
at the strangers, and waiting to hear
their business.</p>

<p>Daph had to set the children down
on the steps, and fumble in her bosom
for the captain&#8217;s precious note. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
drew it at last from its hiding-place,
and handed it triumphantly to the
young porteress, saying, &#8220;Dis is what&#8217;ll
tell you who we are, and what we
wants.&#8221; The little girl looked at the
note with a puzzled expression, and
then calmly walked away, down the
narrow hall, without saying a word.
Daph sat down on the door-step, and
took the children on her lap, with a
kind of faith that all would go well,
which made her feel quite easy. She
was making the children laugh at a
playful pig, that was running up and
down the street, when angry tones
from within met her ear, and she
caught the following words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a negro for a lodger! I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
do no such thing! Who does Captain
Jones think I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said a calm young voice,
&#8220;you know we shall be behind with
the rent, and then, the children are
white; one of them is the whitest child
I ever saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rent, yes, that is a bad business.
Well, I suppose I must come to
it! What one does have to put up
with in this world! Show the woman
in!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph, who had heard the whole
conversation quite plainly, rose at the
last words, and was ready to accept
the invitation to walk into the back
room, which she immediately received.</p>

<p>Daph made a polite courtesy to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
sour-looking little woman, who seemed
hardly strong enough to have spoken
in the loud, harsh tones which had just
been heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Captain Jones sent you here!&#8221;
said the woman, somewhat tartly, as
she eyed the odd-looking party.</p>

<p>Daph had taken off the shawl from
Louise, and set Charlie on his feet,
that the children might appear to the
best advantage; she stood proudly
between them, as she said, &#8220;I wants
to hire a room for my missus&#8217;s children.
We&#8217;s been &#8217;bliged to come north
this summer, and will have to look out
a bit for ourselves, as massa could n&#8217;t
come wid us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Daphne,&#8221; said the woman, sweetening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
a little, &#8220;Captain Jones says that
is your name, and that you are an
honest industrious woman? Do you
think you will be able to pay the rent,
regularly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I has a right to my name,&#8221; said
Daph, straightening up her stout figure.
&#8220;Missus had it gib to me, like any
white folks, when she had me baptised.
I isn&#8217;t particler about having all of it,
so most folks calls me Daph. Is I
honest? Look me in de eye, and
answer dat yeself. Is I industrious?
Look at dat arm, and dese
ere fingers; do dey look like if I was
lazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>The clear eye, muscular arm, and
hard work-worn hand were indeed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
best assurances the doubtful questioner
could have received.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to de rent,&#8221; added Daph, &#8220;my
missus&#8217; children isn&#8217;t widout money.&#8221; As
she spoke, she gave her pocket a hearty
shake, which produced a significant
chinking, that seemed quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a queer one!&#8221; said the
woman, &#8220;but you may as well look at
the room. It&#8217;s right there in front;
you passed it as you came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph stepped to the door of the
front room, pushed it open, and looked
around her, with her head thrown a
little on one side, as if that position
were favorable to forming a correct
judgment as to its merits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it do be radder small,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
said, after a few moment&#8217;s dignified
consideration, &#8220;but den it be proper
clean, and two winder to de street, for
de childen. Haven&#8217;t ye got anything
to put in it; no chair, nor table, nor
such like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to furnish for yourself,&#8221;
said the woman, &#8220;but you shall
have the room on reasonable terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bargain was soon made, but
whether on reasonable terms or not,
Daph had but little idea, though she
prudently concealed her ignorance.</p>

<p>Once in her own domain, Daph sat
down on the floor, and giving each of
the children a huge sea-biscuit, she
took them in her arms, and began to
wave to and fro, singing one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
wild negro melodies, which spring up
wherever the African race take root.</p>

<p>The weary children were soon in a
sound sleep, and then Daph laid them
carefully down on the clean floor,
covered them with the shawls she had
found so useful, and then sat stock-still
beside them, for a few moments, lost
in deep thought. After a while, she
took from her pocket the purse the
captain had given her, and her own
store of small change, wrapped in its
bit of rag. The latter she laid aside,
saying, &#8220;That mus do for eat. Dat
Daph&#8217;s own. Now dis, Daph jus borry
from de cap&#8217;in. Massa&#8217;s children don&#8217;t
have to come to livin on other people
when Daph&#8217;s on her feet. Cap&#8217;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Jones got he money&#8217;s worth in that
beauty gold chain I puts in his hand,
and he not know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Daph gave a real negro chuckle,
at the thought of the artifice, which
had made her feel at liberty to use the
money so kindly given her, without
accepting charity, from which she revolted,
as well for herself as for her
master&#8217;s children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Daph must be gittin dis place
in order quick, or de childen will be
wakin up,&#8221; said Daph, as she rose
hastily with the air of one prepared
for action. She carefully closed the
shutters, locked the door behind her,
and putting the key in her pocket, set
off to make her purchases.</p>

<span class="font">Daph&#8217;s Shopping.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Daph</span> had observed a small cabinet-maker&#8217;s
shop, not far from her new
home, and to it she easily made her
way. The sight of two little wooden
chairs, painted with the usual variety
of wonderfully bright colors, attracted
her attention, and suggested her plan
of operations.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s for de childen I&#8217;se buying,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and what&#8217;s de use ob paying
a big price for grown up things. I just
wants two chairs and a few tings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
match for de dears.&#8221; While Daph was
thus soliloquising, the shopman came
forward, and she promptly addressed
him as follows, &#8220;I&#8217;se jus come, sar, to
buy de fixin ob a leetle room for my
massa&#8217;s childen, General Louis La
Tourette.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph mentioned her master&#8217;s name
with a pompous air, and with great
distinctness, which had their effect on
the humble cabinet-maker. He moved
about briskly, and Daph soon had displayed
before her all the small articles
of furniture he had on hand.</p>

<p>The bright yellow chairs, adorned
with the wonderful roses and tulips,
were first set aside; then followed a
little table, painted in the same fanciful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
manner, and lastly, a good-sized trundle
bed, of a somewhat less gaudy
appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;se in a most pertickler hurry, jus
now,&#8221; said Daph; &#8220;would you jus hab
de kindness to get for de bed jus what
will make it look neat and comfable;
not too nice for childen to play on,
while I steps out for a few notions as
I&#8217;se &#8217;bliged to git.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shopkeeper kindly complied,
while Daph went on her way delighted
at being thus able to have what the
children would need for comfort, a
matter about which she felt herself
quite ignorant in this new climate.</p>

<p>Daph&#8217;s next stop was at a tinman&#8217;s.
Two wash-basins, such as she had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
on board ship, three shining tin cups,
three pewter plates and spoons, one
strong knife and a capacious saucepan,
completed the purchases which she
promptly made. Drawing a gold piece
from the captain&#8217;s purse, she laid it
calmly down on the counter, then
gathered up the various articles selected.
The tinker eyed her a little
suspiciously, but there was no look of
shame or guilt in her frank and honest
face. He concluded she was a servant,
sent out by her mistress, and carefully
gave her the right change, which
seemed, in Daph&#8217;s eyes, to double her
possessions. When she returned to
the cabinet-maker&#8217;s, she found the
trundle-bed neatly fitted out, while a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
lad with a wheelbarrow was ready to
take home the furniture. She added
to her purchases a plain wooden bench,
and then said, composedly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know de valer ob such like tings, but
General Louis La Tourette, my massa,
does, and you must deal right and
honest.&#8221; As she spoke, she laid down
two of her precious gold pieces, then
gathered up the small change returned
to her, not without some misgivings as
to the accuracy of the shopman.</p>

<p>When Daph reached home, she found
the children still sleeping soundly, and
she was able to get the little room in
order to her satisfaction before they
were fairly awake.</p>

<p>She turned up the trundle-bed on end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and threw over it as a curtain the pure
white spread the shopman had provided.
The deep recess on one side of
the chimney, thus shut in, Daph intended
to consider as her private resort,
and in the small cupboard in the
wall, she laid out the children&#8217;s clothes
with scrupulous care. This done, she
set out the little table with the new
cups and plates, and drew the chairs
near it, while the remaining tin treasures
were ranged along the wash-bench
in the most attractive manner.</p>

<p>It was well for Louise and Charlie
that they had been much accustomed
to being away from their mother, or
they might have been poorly prepared
for their present lot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>General La Tourette had married a
young American girl, who was then
living on an island near that on which
his plantation was situated. Shortly
after this marriage, the husband received
a dangerous wound in his side,
which unfitted him for active duty, and
he resolved to settle down on his own
plantation, which had for a long time
been under the care of a most injudicious
overseer.</p>

<p>Daph accompanied her mistress to
her new home, and tried her utmost
skill in cookery to tempt her master&#8217;s
now delicate appetite. Even her
powers were at last at fault, and
General La Tourette could not taste
the tempting morsels which the faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
creature loved always to prepare
for him.</p>

<p>Frequent change of air was now
prescribed for the invalid, and the fond
mother was almost constantly separated
from the children she so tenderly loved;
yet her sweet, devoted, christian character
had already made its impression on
the little Louise.</p>

<p>Thus situated, the children had
learned to be happy for the present
hour, with any one who happened to
have the charge of them. General La
Tourette, though a native of France,
spoke English in his family, and to
that language his little ones were accustomed.
They took no fancy to the
cross French nurse who had latterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
had the charge of them, and much
preferred Daph, whose English was
pleasant to their ears. They loved to
linger at the door of her southern
kitchen, or play under the wide-spreading
tree that waved over its
roof.</p>

<p>Daph returned their affection with
all the strength of her warm heart,
and Mrs. La Tourette felt sure that in
her absence, Daph would watch over
both children and nurse with an eagle-eye.</p>

<p>With more of the dove than the
eagle in her expression, Daph now sat
beside the little ones in their new
home, so far from the land of their
birth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>Not long after her preparations were
completed, Daph had the satisfaction
of seeing the children awake, refreshed
by their long sleep, and full of eager
delight at the wonders achieved by
their new nurse. She listened with
hearty satisfaction to their exclamations
of surprise and pleasure at the
shining tin and gayly painted chairs.</p>

<p>Daph was just wondering what was
to fill plates and cups that looked so
attractive, when a bell was rung imperatively,
in the street, before the
house. From all sides women and
girls gathered round the bell-ringer&#8217;s
cart, and from his great cans he filled
their vessels with milk, which was at
this moment most refreshing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
eyes of Daph. She seized her new
saucepan, and sallying out, presented
it to the milkman, and received her
supply. She watched carefully the
bits of money given by other applicants
and was fortunate enough to select,
from the change she had that day received,
the right payment for the milk.</p>

<p>In a few moments, the children
were seated at the little table, and enjoying
their nice supper of crackers and
milk, in a way that made Daph&#8217;s eyes
sparkle with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daffy eat too!&#8221; said Charlie, motioning
to her to put the spoon in her
mouth, instead of his own. &#8220;Yes,
Daffy,&#8221; said Louise, &#8220;do take some
supper.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>Daph had hardly thought once of
herself during the whole of this busy
afternoon, but when the children had
finished their meal, she filled her cup
with the fare they had enjoyed, and
ate it with no less satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daph knew de great Lord would
take care of us!&#8221; she murmured, as
she looked round on the room that
seemed to her so comfortable, and
true, fervent gratitude, undisturbed
by one fear for the future, filled the
heart of the faithful negro.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI.<br />

<span class="font">Clouds.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Alas</span> for Daph! She was soon to
find life was not all sunshine in her
northern home. The lovely May weather,
which had been like a pleasant
welcome to the strangers, suddenly
vanished, and was succeeded by dark
clouds, pouring rain, and keen easterly
winds. Daph was glad to keep the
children wrapped in the bed-clothes,
while she racked her ingenuity to find
means of amusing them. Charlie took
a wash-basin for a drum, and the pewter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
spoon with which he beat it was a
constant and patient sufferer. Louise
was not so easily pleased; she began
to miss her mother sorely, and tried
poor Daph, by pleading piteously to
see her &#8220;own dear mamma.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph had tried to banish from her
mind all thoughts of her master and
mistress, for the bare imagination of
what they might have suffered made
her wild with distress. She said to
herself, &#8220;What for Daph go to tink
about tings, jus as likely nebber
was at all! Daph makes out de
great Lord could n&#8217;t save massa and
Miss Elize all hisself, widout Daph to
help him! Foolish darky! She better
cheer up, and take care ob de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
childen, &#8217;stead o&#8217; jus whimper, whimper,
like a sick monkey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph had to go through a course of
consolation, similar to the above, very
frequently, to enable her to maintain
her cheerfulness; but the piteous
questionings of the little Louise well-nigh
overcame all the poor negro&#8217;s
philosophy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;se tell you what it is, Miss Lou,&#8221;
poor Daph said, desperately, at last,
&#8220;I&#8217;se jus tell you what it is; de great
Lord is a-takin care ob your mamma,
and if you&#8217;s a good girl, you&#8217;ll jus see
her some day, and if you is not, de
great Lord will nebber, nebber bring
you together!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph&#8217;s manner, as well as her words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
had some effect upon Louise, and she
tried to content herself with watching
the rain streaming down the window-panes,
and was soon in a sufficiently
cheerful mood to march up and down
the room, to the sound of Charlie&#8217;s
music, greatly to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>The dreary weather without was not
all that Daph had to contend with; she
found she had an enemy within the
house, whose attacks it was far more
difficult to meet.</p>

<p>The little woman, whose angry voice
had attracted Daph&#8217;s attention at first,
kept her humble lodger familiar with
its harsh tones. Daph&#8217;s appearance
was the signal for a volley of complaints,
as to the noise made by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
children, the marks left on the floor by
Daph&#8217;s feet, as she returned from the
well, the unpleasantness of &#8220;seeing
other folks so much at home in one&#8217;s
own house,&#8221; etc., etc.</p>

<p>Daph never had a chance to get any
further than, &#8220;deed, Miss Ray!&#8221; in
her attempts at self-justification, for
the opening of her mouth was sure to
produce another tirade on the &#8220;impudence
of certain people, that nobody
knew anything about.&#8221;</p>

<p>The demure-looking little girl was
generally a silent spectator of these
attacks, but now and then she was
forced to cry out, &#8220;O, mother! don&#8217;t!&#8221;
which protest was generally met by a
sharp box of the ear, and a &#8220;take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
that, Mary, and learn to be quiet!&#8221;
If Mary Ray had learned any lesson,
it certainly was to be quiet. She
rarely spoke, and her footsteps were
almost as noiseless as the fall of the
winter snow.</p>

<p>Daph soon found out that Mrs. Ray
considered Mary especially guilty, in
having presumed to live, when her
brother, a fine healthy boy, had been
snatched away by sudden disease.</p>

<p>The loss of her husband, and consequent
poverty, had somewhat soured
Mrs. Ray&#8217;s temper, but her last bereavement
seemed to have made her all acidity.
She constantly reproached Mary
for being a useless girl, always in her
mother&#8217;s sight, when the dear boy, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
whom she had hoped to lean, had been
taken from her.</p>

<p>Daph&#8217;s keen sympathies were soon
warmly enlisted for little Mary, who
had really begun to believe she was
quite in fault for continuing to cumber
the earth, when nobody wanted her
here.</p>

<p>Daph never passed Mary without a
cheerful word, and she contrived to
show the child many trifling acts of
kindness, which went directly to her
heart.</p>

<p>At one time Daph, with her strong
arm, lifted Mary&#8217;s heavy pail of water,
at another, she took her pitcher to the
milkman in a pouring rain; and one
day, when she could think of no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
way of showing her interest, she secretly
bestowed on the little girl one of
the few oranges which still remained of
the store brought from the ship.</p>

<p>Mary&#8217;s sorrowful face, Mrs. Ray&#8217;s
harsh voice, the penetrating chill in
the air, and the monotonous life she
led in the single room, made it hard
for Daph to bear up cheerfully, and,
but for the children, she would have
withdrawn to a corner, and moped all
the time. She managed to keep up
her spirits during the day, but when
the little ones were asleep, she had her
own sad, wakeful hours. More than a
week had passed in this dreary way.
Daph saw her treasured store of money
fast diminishing, under the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
expenditure for supplying the simple
wants of her little establishment, and
she already saw, too plainly, that the
whole party must soon have a new
outfit of clothing, or they would be
disgraced by their rags and uncleanliness.</p>

<p>The children were quietly slumbering
near her; she had extinguished
the candle, that it might not waste its
feeble light, and, with her head on her
hand, she began to consider seriously
the situation in which she found herself.
The present was dark enough,
but what was she to think of the
gloomy future!</p>

<p>Where should she look for the work
she would so willingly do? How could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
she leave her little charge, even if that
work were found?</p>

<p>A sense of utter helplessness came
over the poor negro, and hot tears
poured down her cheeks.</p>

<p>A sudden thought struck her; there
was One all-powerful, and to Him she
would go. She fell on her knees, and
uttered her first simple prayer: &#8220;Will
de great Lord gib poor Daph something
for do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Overpowered by the effort she had
made, and fearful there was something
presuming in a poor creature like herself
daring to speak to the being she
so reverenced, Daph sank down on the
floor, in a position of silent humility.
A conviction that she had been heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and forgiven for the boldness of her
prayer stole over her, and she stretched
herself as usual on the bare floor, and
was soon in a sound sleep.</p>

<span class="font">A New Path.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Daph</span> rose the following morning,
at her usual early hour, and went to
perform her customary ablutions beside
the well, keeping, however, a sharp
look out for Mrs. Ray, to be ready to
beat a retreat as soon as that formidable
person should make herself heard.
No Mrs. Ray appeared, and Daph&#8217;s
curiosity tempted her to take a peep
into the room which served as kitchen,
parlor, and general abiding-place for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Mrs. Ray and Mary, though they slept
in the loft above.</p>

<p>Mary was diligently ironing, at this
early hour, giving from time to time,
dolorous glances at a great basketful
of damp clothes, which seemed to
diminish but slowly under her efforts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your ma?&#8221; said Daph, as
she thrust her head fairly in at the
door, regardless of consequences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;s very sick this morning,&#8221;
said Mary, sorrowfully, &#8220;she can&#8217;t
even turn herself in bed, and all these
clothes must go home to-night, we
have had to keep them too long now, it
has been so wet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nebber fret bout de close,&#8221; said
Daph, cheerily; &#8220;I&#8217;se held a flat &#8217;fore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
dis! Do Daph good to work a little,
she mighty tired, sittin up all day like
a lady. Spose I jus steps up to look
at your ma. May be I might do somewhat
for her, to make her feel some
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, don&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Mary, hastily,
&#8220;she might not like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nebber you mind dat!&#8221; said Daph,
&#8220;you jus show me de way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary pointed to the door that led to
the narrow staircase, and Daph needed
no further guidance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;s mighty sick, isn&#8217;t ye, Miss&#8217;
Ray?&#8221; said Daph, compassionately, as
she stepped to the bedside of the sufferer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray turned her head to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
wall and groaned, but Daph was not
to be easily disconcerted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spose I jus makes you a little
warm drink, and kinder helps you to
frow off dis ere sickness?&#8221; said Daph,
insinuatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, my back! my bones! they ache
so!&#8221; said the poor woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s jus bein out in dis wet wedder,
jus a-comin from dat awful hot fire
into de swash down rain,&#8221; said Daph.
&#8220;White folks isn&#8217;t used to such hard
work. You jus can&#8217;t bear it, dats
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph had struck the right cord, and
Mrs. Ray answered, &#8220;No; I aint used
to it. That&#8217;s true enough, but who
have I got to help me, but just that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
slip of a girl. O, if my boy had only
lived!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph did not wait to hear more of
the complaints, which were the burden
of Mrs. Ray&#8217;s daily talk. She hastened
to the kitchen, and with Mary&#8217;s help,
she soon prepared a steaming bowl of
of herb-tea, which Mrs. Ray took from
her hand without a word. She would
have resisted, when Daph proceeded to
bathe her feet in warm water, but the
kind-hearted negro went steadily on,
regardless of opposition, saying, &#8220;You&#8217;s
so very sick, we&#8217;s mus jus take care of
you, same as if you were a bit of a
baby. There now, let me jus put de
cubber over you,&#8221; she said, as she released
the restive feet. &#8220;Now, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
could jus git a little sleep, while I go
dress de babies, I&#8217;se do believe you
would feel mighty better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray did fall into a quiet sleep,
the more sound from the night of
wakefulness and pain she had just
passed. When she awoke, she heard
unusual sounds in the kitchen below,
and if she could have peeped down the
stair-way, a pleasant scene would have
met her eyes. A cheerful fire roared
up the wide chimney. Daph, revived
by the welcome heat, was ironing away
at the great table, with real heartiness,
while little Mary, at her side, tried to
move her slender arms in the same
energetic manner. Charlie was seated
on the table, a happy spectator of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
these proceedings, while Louise stood
by him, sprinkling and folding a bit of
rag again and again, not doubting that
she was amazingly useful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary! Mary!&#8221; said a voice from
above, feebler and a little less sharp
than usual, &#8220;who&#8217;s down there with
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s jus me and de childen, Miss&#8217;
Ray,&#8221; said Daph, putting her head fearlessly
up the stair-way. &#8220;Dat big
basket o&#8217; clothes wants &#8217;tention, and
I&#8217;se jus thought I&#8217;se better be ironin a
bit, to git de tings out de way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray made no answer, and
Daph, after satisfying herself that the
patient was a little better, stepped
quietly back into the kitchen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>Daph really enjoyed her busy day,
and it was followed by sound natural
sleep, instead of hours of wakefulness
and anxious thought.</p>

<p>It was more than a week before
Mrs. Ray recovered from the violent
cold which had so suddenly removed
her from the scene of operations;
meanwhile Daph and Mary had become
excellent friends. The little girl
exchanged her hard work for the pleasant
care of the children, and Daph&#8217;s
strong arms had the exercise they
needed. Daph&#8217;s busy brain had not
meanwhile been idle; the sight of the
great oven in the wide chimney-corner
had suggested to her a plan, which she
was impatient to carry out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>When Mrs. Ray first appeared in the
kitchen, she gave an anxious look
about her, as if she expected to see
nothing but disorder and dirt; but the
well-scoured floor and shining plates
on the dresser had another tale to tell.
Of Daph&#8217;s skill in cookery, she had
tasted several striking specimens, since
her appetite had in a measure returned,
and she looked on somewhat
curiously, as Daph busied herself
about the fire, preparing what she
called, &#8220;Just a bit relish, to strengthen
up Miss&#8217; Ray, now she&#8217;s on her two
feet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary was with the children, and
Mrs. Ray took the opportunity to say,
&#8220;You have been very good to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Daph, and I am sure you had no reason;&#8221;
and tears of shame actually
came into the poor woman&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t, Miss&#8217; Ray!&#8221; said Daph,
&#8220;I&#8217;se isn&#8217;t been and done anything at
all. Come, take a little breakfast, and
ye&#8217;ll feel better, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I do for you, Daph?&#8221;
continued Mrs. Ray, who had been
really touched by the persevering kindness
of the honest negro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now, Miss&#8217; Ray,&#8221; said Daph,
&#8220;I wants to make a little money. I
jus thinks I might do de ironin for
you ebery week, for you can&#8217;t stand
such hard work, and then, may be
you&#8217;d jus let me hab de use ob dat
beauty oven, for somewhat I wants to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
do. I&#8217;se jus used to cookin, and may
be, if I makes some ob de cakes missus
used to like so much, I might sell dem,
at some ob de grand houses, and so
make a pretty sum, by-and-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>This arrangement was easily made,
for Mrs. Ray felt within her but little
strength for work, and she was also
anxious to shew her sense of Daph&#8217;s
late kindness.</p>

<p>One bright June morning, Daph put
herself in what she called &#8220;splinker
order,&#8221; and the children shouted with
delight when her toilet was made.
With the help of Mrs. Ray and Mary
she had cut out and completed a good
calico dress, and a full white apron,
and these, with her snowy turban,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
made a most respectable appearance.
A new basket, covered with a clean
cloth, was on her head, and within it
was stored a variety of nice cakes,
which she was proud to show as a
specimen of her cookery.</p>

<p>Mary stood at the window with the
children, as Daph went off, and the
little ones kissed their hands to her
until she was fairly out of sight.</p>

<p>Daph had learned her way about
the city with ease, for she had quick
observation, and a ready memory, and
she now found no difficulty in reaching
what she called the &#8220;grand houses,&#8221;
which were ranged in imposing rows,
on what is now one of the business
streets.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>At door after door she tried to gain
admittance, but the consequential servants
turned her off with a contemptuous
word, and her heart began to sink
within her. At last, as an imperative
footman was ordering her away from
a great family mansion, two ladies
passed out, to enter a carriage. Daph
was desperate. She dropped a curtsy
and said, &#8220;Ladies, like some nice
cakes?&#8221; and at the same moment she
lowered her basket, uncovered it, and
displayed its tempting array.</p>

<p>The frank, good face of the negro,
and the attractive appearance of her
wares, secured the attention of the
ladies, and they purchased largely.
Encouraged by their kindness, Daph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
said, &#8220;If de ladies would jus speak
for Daph to some ob de great folks, to
buy from her Tuesdays and Fridays,
Daph would try to please dem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like the woman, mother,&#8221; said
Rose Stuyvesant, &#8220;shall we engage
her to come here always, and see what
we can do for her?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother assented, and Daph,
turning to express her gratitude, looked
into the face of the youngest speaker.</p>

<p>It was a sweet face for man or angel
to look into. Nature had made it fair,
and parted the golden hair above the
soft blue eyes; but there was a sweetness
round the expressive mouth, and
a purity in every line of the oval face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
that told of a soul at peace with God,
and ruled by his holy law.</p>

<p>Daph long remembered that face,
and as she visited the Stuyvesant mansion,
week after week, she deemed
that a bright day when she caught
even a glimpse of her, whom she called
&#8220;the sweet young lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Time passed on, and Daph thrived
in her little traffic, until her cakes were
well known, and her form eagerly
looked for in many a splendid home;
but the best triumphs of her skill she
ever reserved for the Stuyvesant mansion,
where she had first found a welcome.</p>

<span class="font">News.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the honest efforts of poor Daph
were crowned with success, she found
herself abundantly able to provide for
the physical wants of her master&#8217;s
children. Three years of toil had
rolled quickly away. Charlie had passed
his fourth birth-day, and become a
strong-willed, sturdy boy, while the
slender figure of the fair Louise had
grown and rounded, and the Rose had
learned to bloom on the cheek of Captain
Jones&#8217;s &#8220;Water-lily.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Daph looked at her little ones with
affectionate pride, and watched over
them with the most tender care. She
encouraged them to play in the small
garden in the rear of their humble
home, but in the street they were
never seen. The garments she fashioned
for them were neat and tidy, and the
snowy aprons they always wore, were
monuments of her skill as a laundress;
but she was conscious of a something
in their external appearance, which
was not as it should be. About the
manners of her charge, Daph was still
more troubled. &#8220;Why you eat so,
Miss Lou?&#8221; she would sometimes say.
&#8220;How shall I eat, Daffy?&#8221; the child
would reply. &#8220;Well, I jus don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
know,&#8221; poor Daph would answer,
&#8220;but dere&#8217;s somewhat bout de way
you childen do be, at de table, dat
Daph don&#8217;t jus know how to spress it.&#8221;</p>

<p>More serious troubles than these by
degrees came upon Daph, in her
management. Charlie, though an affectionate,
generous child, was hot-tempered
and wilful, and when he resisted
Daph&#8217;s authority, or raised his
little hand to give an angry blow, the
poor creature knew not what to do.
In these scenes she generally triumphed,
by the look of real distress which
clouded her usually pleasant face, and
brought Charlie, repentant to her
arms.</p>

<p>With Louise, Daph had another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
difficulty. The child was usually gentle
and submissive, but she seemed to
pine for other companions, and a home
different from that which Daph was
able to provide for her.</p>

<p>The early lessons of piety which
Louise had learned at her mother&#8217;s
knee, had faded from her mind. Daph
could remind the little girl to say her
simple prayer at morning and evening,
but she could not talk to her of the
loving Saviour, or recount the wonders
of the Gospel she had never read.</p>

<p>The little book, with the golden
clasps, Daph had cherished with the
utmost care. She knew it contained
the secret which could bring peace and
order to her little home, but its treasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
she, in her ignorance, could not
unlock.</p>

<p>Once she had ventured to ask Mrs.
Ray to read a little to her from it, but
she met with a short negative, and a
cold, averted look.</p>

<p>Mary was almost as ignorant of letters
as Daph herself. So the poor
negro kept the precious book unopened,
and awaited God&#8217;s time for
leading her from darkness unto light.</p>

<p>That the children of her dear mistress
would be allowed to grow up,
ignorant of the knowledge that belonged
to their station, and strangers
to the Bible their mother had loved,
Daph would not allow herself to believe.
&#8220;It will come, I&#8217;se sure!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Daph would say to herself; &#8220;de great
Lord can make it right!&#8221; and thus she
stifled her anxious forebodings, and
strove to do the duty of the present
hour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray&#8217;s temper was not quite as
trying as when Daph first made her
acquaintance. The kindness of the
honest negro, and her cheerful acceptance
of the trials of her lot, had their
influence under that humble roof, and
won respect and affection, even from
Mrs. Ray. The sunshine of Charlie&#8217;s
happy, roguish face, had cheered the
lonely widow, and Louise had exerted
on her a softening, refining influence.
Mrs. Ray was improved, but not thoroughly
changed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>Little Mary had many harsh words
yet to hear, but time had abated the
poignancy of the mother&#8217;s grief for
her lost darling, and made her somewhat
more alive to the virtues of her
hard-working, quiet, little girl.</p>

<p>During the three years that had passed,
since they had dwelt under the
same roof, sickness, at various times,
had made the little household seem
like one family, and the habit of helping
each other had daily drawn them
nearer.</p>

<p>Mary&#8217;s demure face was lighted up
with wonder as she said to Daph, one
day, &#8220;There&#8217;s a gentleman at the
door, asking if mother still lives here,
and if you are at home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>&#8220;Is it a tall, tall gentleman, that
looks grand-like and magnificent?&#8221;
said Daph, earnestly, as the thought of
her master at once rose to her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; said Mary, and, as
she spoke, Mrs. Ray opened the door,
and ushered in Captain Jones.</p>

<p>Although her first feeling was disappointment,
Daph shed tears of joy
as she clasped the hand of the honest
captain; her tears, however, brightened
into smiles as she saw the approving
look the captain bestowed on her pets,
as he caught them in his arms.</p>

<p>Charlie struggled and fought to be
free, shouting, &#8220;I like you, sir, but
you need not squeeze me so, and rub
me with your rough whiskers.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>Charlie got another hug for an answer,
while Louise said, &#8220;Who is it,
Daph? It cannot be my father!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! darling!&#8221; said the captain,
quickly, and he dashed the tears
from his eyes, and was sobered in an
instant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray looked on with astonishment
and curiosity, at the cordial
meeting between her old acquaintance
and her lodgers.</p>

<p>Captain Jones had known Mrs. Ray
slightly in her better days, and he now
turned to her, and inquired kindly
after her welfare. As usual, she had
a series of grievances to relate, but
she forbore speaking slightingly of
Mary, who had modestly retired into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the background. The little girl was
somewhat astonished when the captain
came towards her, and gave her a
hearty greeting, as the child of his old
mess-mate, and seemed to think her
well worth speaking to, though &#8220;only
a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole party sat down together,
and time passed rapidly on, while the
captain sat, with the children in his
arms, and heard Daph&#8217;s account of her
various trials and adventures since they
parted. Mrs. Ray listened with eager
curiosity, but she could gather little
from Daph&#8217;s words that she did not
already know.</p>

<p>At length, Captain Jones said, with
a great effort, &#8220;Daph, I have something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to say to you, which is not fit for
the children&#8217;s ears,&#8221; and he gave at
the same time an expressive glance towards
Mrs. Ray.</p>

<p>The widow seized Mary by the hand,
and flounced indignantly out of the
room, saying, &#8220;I am sure we have too
much to do to stay here, where we are
not wanted. No good comes of secrets,
that ever I heard of!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come children, come with Mary,&#8221;
said the girl, apparently unconscious
of her mother&#8217;s indignant manner.</p>

<p>The children followed somewhat reluctantly,
and Daph and the captain
were left alone together. Since the
moment of her landing, Daph had had
no one to whom she might speak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the dark fears for her master and mistress,
that at times preyed upon her;
to her own strange departure she had
never alluded. She had met questionings
with dignified silence, and had
patiently endured insinuations, which,
but for her clear conscience, would
have driven her to frenzy. Now, she
felt that she was to hear some important
news, and her trembling knees
refused to support her. Anxious and
agitated, she sank on her low bench,
and fixed her eyes eagerly on the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daph,&#8221; he began, &#8220;there was
horrible truth in your words that
night, when you pleaded so earnestly
on board the Martha Jane! I thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
God that I did not turn a deaf ear to
you then! Daph, you have saved
your master&#8217;s children from a bloody
death, and you will be rewarded, as
there is a Father in Heaven!&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain paused, and Daph bent
anxiously forward, exclaiming, &#8220;My
dear missus? master?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Jones could not speak. He
drew his hand significantly across his
throat, and then pointed solemnly upwards.</p>

<p>Daph understood his meaning but
too well. She had hoped on, determinately;
but now the hour of awful
certainty had come, and she could not
bear it. She gave one loud scream,
and fell senseless on the floor. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
wild yell that burst from the anguished
heart of the negro, rang through the
house, and Mrs. Ray and Mary were
at the door in a moment, followed by
the terrified children. Little Louise
dropped down beside Daph, and began
to cry piteously, while Charlie flew at
Captain Jones like a young lion, and
loudly exclaiming, &#8220;The naughty man
has killed dear Daffy, and I&#8217;ll punish
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Mrs. Ray and her daughter
were making every effort to recall poor
Daph to consciousness, Charlie continued
his attack upon the captain,
with sturdy foot, clenched hand, and
sharp teeth, until the honest sailor was
actually obliged to protect himself, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
putting the child forcibly from the
room, and firmly locking the door.</p>

<p>Perfectly infuriated, Charlie flew into
the street, screaming, &#8220;They&#8217;ve killed
my Daffy! The wicked! wicked man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several persons gathered round the
enraged child, and a young physician,
who was passing, stopped, to find out
the cause of the disturbance. Charlie&#8217;s
words, &#8220;She lies dead there! The
wicked man has killed her,&#8221; caught the
attention of Dr. Bates, and he eagerly
asked, &#8220;Where, where, child?&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie pointed towards the house,
and the doctor entered, without ceremony,
Charlie closely following him.
His loud knock was answered by Captain
Jones, whose cautious manner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
unlocking the door seemed, to the
young physician, a most suspicious circumstance.</p>

<p>Charlie no sooner caught sight of his
enemy than he leaped furiously upon
him. The strong sailor received him
in his muscular arms, and there held
him, a most unwilling prisoner, while
he watched the proceedings going on
about poor Daph, and rendered assistance
where he could.</p>

<p>Dr. Bates ordered her clothes to be
instantly loosened, and then commanded
Mrs. Ray to lay her flat on the
floor, while he proceeded to apply his
lancet to her arm.</p>

<p>While this process was going on, the
clock on a neighboring steeple struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
twelve. Captain Jones looked hastily
at his great silver watch, and saw that
it was indeed midday, and he had not
a moment to spare, as the Martha Jane
was by this time quite ready to set sail,
and only waiting for her captain.</p>

<p>He hurriedly placed a little parcel on
the mantel-piece, and with one long,
sorrowful look at poor Daph, and a
hasty farewell to Mrs. Ray and the
children, he left the house.</p>

<p>It was long before Daph returned to
consciousness, and when her eyes once
more opened they were wild with fever
and anguish. She declared, however,
that she was quite well, and would
have no one about her; she longed to
be alone, to struggle with her great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
sorrow. The children would not leave
her, but it was in vain they tried their
little expressions of tenderness, and
begged her look once more like their
&#8220;own dear Daffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sight of the unconscious orphans
redoubled the grief of the poor negro,
and she burst into a flood of tears.
The poor children, overcome at this
unwonted sight, sank down beside her,
and mingled their tears with hers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray and the young doctor
were sorely puzzled by the strange
scenes they had witnessed. They had
both seen the rich chains about Daph&#8217;s
neck, which had been disclosed while
she was unconscious, and not a little
wonder was excited by the sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
that expensive jewelry in such a place.
Dr. Bates had not failed to observe the
refined appearance of the fair Louise
and the noble bearing of little Charlie,
contrasting as they did so strangely,
with the plainness of their humble
home, and the unmistakable African
face of the woman, of whom they
seemed so fond.</p>

<p>The wild agitation of Daph, the
disappearance of the sun-browned
stranger, the necklaces, the children,
all tended to fill the mind of Dr. Bates
with dark suspicion. He lingered
about Daph as long as he could make
any excuse for doing so, and when he
reluctantly turned from the room, he
did not leave the house without thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
questioning Mrs. Ray as to
what she knew of her lodgers. Mrs.
Ray had but little to tell, excepting,
that they had been commended to her,
three years before, by the same tall
sailor, whose appearance that day had
created such a commotion. Of Captain
Jones she could only say, that he had
been a mess-mate of her husband,
years before, and had always been
reckoned an honest, kind-hearted man.</p>

<p>The questions put by Dr. Bates
roused all the curiosity of Mrs. Ray,
and revived the suspicions, with regard
to Daph, which had been much in her
mind during the early days of their
acquaintance. Such thoughts had long
since been banished, by the honest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
upright life of the kind-hearted, industrious
negro, but now they rose with
new strength.</p>

<p>She recalled the richly embroidered
dresses in which the children sometimes
appeared, the first summer after
their arrival, and she dwelt on the reluctance
which Daph always exhibited
to answering any questions as to her
past life, or the circumstances attending
her departure from her southern
home.</p>

<p>These remembrances and suspicions
she detailed to the willing ear of Dr.
Bates, who was satisfied that he was
on the eve of unraveling some tangled
web of iniquity, and with slow and
thoughtful steps he walked away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the humble home, so wrapped in mystery.</p>

<p>Once more left to herself, Mrs. Ray
felt ashamed of having doubted poor
Daph, and was half inclined to go to
her, and frankly own the misgivings
the late occurrences had excited; but
the thought of those strange circumstances
again set her curiously at work,
and all right feeling was soon lost, in
an eager anxiety to find out the dark
secret, which hung like a cloud over
the poor negro.</p>

<span class="font">A Ministering Spirit.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Daph</span> had been smitten by a blow
too sudden and violent, to rally immediately
from its effects. Her strength
and energy seemed forever gone. The
hope which had upheld her had been
stricken from her, and she knew not
where to go for comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;De great Lord has gib poor Daph
up!&#8221; she said, disconsolately; and,
prostrate in mind and body, she lay on
her low bed, her eyes shut, and her
soul all dark within.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>It was now that Mary Ray had an
opportunity of showing her deep gratitude,
for the unwearied kindness of her
humble friend. She assumed the care
of the children, and tried to keep
them happy out of Daph&#8217;s sight, and
thoughtfully volunteered to go round
herself to Daph&#8217;s customers, to tell
them that sickness had prevented her
from preparing her usual supply.</p>

<p>All that Mary offered, Daph quietly
accepted, almost without opening her
eyes.</p>

<p>Daph seemed to have no wants, and
it was in vain that Mrs. Ray came in
and out, and bustled about putting the
room in order, opening and closing the
shutters, and making herself very busy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
to no possible advantage; Daph did
not notice her; her thoughts were far,
far away.</p>

<p>In one of these visits, Mrs. Ray
chanced to find the gold chain the captain
had laid on the mantel-piece.
This added fuel to her suspicions, and
she felt justified in secreting it, and
showing it to Dr. Bates, as a further
proof of the mystery clinging to Daph.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray&#8217;s mind was in a most
agitated state. Sometimes she was
haunted with vague notions of some
most awful crime committed by Daph,
and then again the kind, truthful face
of the negro would rise up before her,
and change her suspicions into shame
and self-reproach.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>At such times, she could not help
feeling, that only virtue and honesty
could be at home in a heart capable of
such generous forgiveness, and patient
return of good for evil, as she had
received from the now sorrow-stricken
negro. These moments of relenting,
to soon alas! were gone.</p>

<p>Daph was lying sad and alone in the
silent room, a few days after the visit
of Captain Jones, when she heard a
low tap at the door, followed by Mrs.
Ray&#8217;s loud voice, saying, &#8220;Walk right
in, Miss. She aint much sick, to my
notion, but she don&#8217;t take no notice of
anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph did notice the stranger who
entered, and she even smiled sorrowfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
as she looked up into the face of
Rose Stuyvesant.</p>

<p>&#8220;We missed your nice cakes on the
table, Daph,&#8221; said a soft voice, &#8220;and
when I heard you were sick, I determined
to come and see you myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words of kindness from a refined
and gentle woman, melted the
heart of the suffering negro. She
burst into tears as she exclaimed, &#8220;O,
my sweet young lady! You speaks to
poor Daph like her own dear missus
used to!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose Stuyvesant sat down beside the
low bed that Mary had spread for Daph
on the floor. &#8220;Are you very sick,
Daph?&#8221; she asked, tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daph is all dead here, and all dizzy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
here,&#8221; said the poor creature, laying
her hand first on her heart, and then
on her head. &#8220;De great Lord has
sent Daph a big trouble, and den gib
her right up;&#8221; and the tears again
flowed fast.</p>

<p>Rose bent over the unhappy negro,
and said, gently, &#8220;The great Lord
loves you too well, Daph, to give you
up in your trouble. Perhaps he has
sent me to comfort you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph looked up with a gleam of hope
in her eye, and murmured, &#8220;No reason
why Daph should n&#8217;t jus tell all de
truth now. Perhaps, if de sweet
young lady knows all, she may comfort
Daph up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord Jesus can comfort us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
any trouble,&#8221; said Rose, softly. &#8220;What
makes you so unhappy? Cannot you
tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph looked long into the sweet
face turned lovingly towards her, and
then said, &#8220;De great Lord has sent
a-most an angel to poor Daph, and she
shall hear it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The secret that had so long burdened
the lonely negro, was now poured
out with all the unconscious eloquence
of a true, warm, single-heart. The
tears flowed fast down the cheeks of
Rose Stuyvesant, as she heard the
simple story of devoted, heroic affection,
and long, patient self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>She understood the hope that had
cheered Daph through years of labor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
and anxiety,&mdash;the hope of placing the
children of her mistress again on the
bosom that had nursed them, and of
seeing the happy father again embrace
his long lost ones. That hope was
now forever gone, and Rose Stuyvesant
mingled her tears with those of poor
Daph, as she concluded her story.</p>

<p>Those real tears made Daph feel that
she had found a true friend, who sympathised
with her in her distress, and
this in itself was a whisper of comfort.</p>

<p>As soon as Rose could command
herself, she said, as she took the black
hand in her own, &#8220;Daph, the mother
who loved to teach her little ones of
Jesus, has gone to be with Him. Your
master, too, is now with the Heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
King. You will still be able to give
them back their children, in that better
land, where there is no parting, where
no sorrow ever comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The negro looked earnestly in the
face of the speaker, as she went on;
&#8220;You must teach the little ones to
love the Lord Jesus, and lead them to
his home in heaven. Daph, you have
that now to do, and that is worth living
and striving for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall poor Daph show the
way to heaven; she don&#8217;t know it jus
zactly herself,&#8221; said the poor creature,
and the momentary gleam of hope
faded from her face as she spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus Christ has opened the door
of heaven wide, for all that love Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and trust Him,&#8221; said Rose, eagerly;
&#8220;His blood, shed on the cross, can
wash away the sins of the whole
world. The great Lord will forgive
you all that is past, and receive you
into heaven, for Jesus&#8217; sake, if you
really wish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else Daph want now in dis
world, but jus know de way to heaven
herself, and lead de childen dere?&#8221;
was the earnest reply.</p>

<p>Poor Daph had been entrusted with
but little religious knowledge, but to
that she had clung in simple faith
through all her trials. She had improved
the few talents that had been
given her, and now came her reward
in the fulness of the light of the gospel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>Again, and again her young teacher
explained the way of forgiveness and
eternal peace through the blood of
Christ.</p>

<p>At last the beauty, freedom, and
matchless love of the plan of redemption
burst upon her, and there was
joy in heaven, when the poor negro in
the midst of her tears, welcomed
Christ as her Saviour, and knew &#8220;the
great Lord,&#8221; as her reconciled Father
in heaven.</p>

<p>While the long conversation, so full
of moment to Daph, was taking place,
Mary Ray had kept the children happy
in the little garden. Their patience
at last gave way, and they pleaded so
hard &#8220;Just to look at dear Daffy,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
that their young nurse could resist
them no longer.</p>

<p>Charlie burst impetuously into the
room, unmindful of the stranger, while
Louise more timidly followed. Warm
tears filled the eyes of Rose Stuyvesant
as she looked, for the first time, on
the orphans. Charlie saw immediately
the happy change that had passed
over Daph&#8217;s face, and walking straight
up to her, he said exultingly &#8220;Daffy&#8217;s
better! Daffy&#8217;s better! Good Daffy!&#8221;
and he laid his curly head on her dark
arm which told how dearly she was
beloved.</p>

<p>A peculiar attraction seemed to
draw Louise to the side of the stranger,
and when she was tenderly kissed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
and that sweet, soft, face bent down to
hers, with loving interest, the child put
her head on the bosom of Rose Stuyvesant,
clung to her neck and sobbed
as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not mamma!&#8221; murmured the
child; and then more and more fondly
embraced one, who had brought back
from the dim recesses of memory, the
image of her long-lost mother.</p>

<p>Rose was but little less moved than
the child, and in her heart she prayed
that she might give to the little one
such lessons in holiness, as would win
an approving smile, were they heard
by that mother in heaven.</p>

<p>By degrees, the agitation of little
Louise subsided, but she quietly kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
her seat on the lap of her new friend,
and seemed to find a new pleasure in
looking into her kind face and smoothing
her fair, soft hand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Daph drew from her
pocket a parcel, which she had ever
carried about her, perhaps with the
vague idea that it had some talismanic
charm to keep her from evil. Wrapper
after wrapper was taken off, until
at last the little book with golden
clasps appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was all about Him, I know,&#8221;
said Daph, &#8220;about that good Saviour,
but Daph can&#8217;t read the blessed
book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose took the Bible that was handed
to her and read on the fly-leaf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
&#8220;Elize Latourette, from her devoted
husband. One Lord, one faith, one
baptism!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sight of that book in the hands
of Rose, again awoke the dim memories
of the child on her knee, and
Louise, through fresh tears, was doubly
drawn towards her new friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suffer little children to come unto
me, and forbid them not, for of such is
the kingdom of heaven,&#8221; read the
sweet voice of Rose. &#8220;All are the
children of Jesus, who put their trust
in Him, and truly love Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A thrill passed over the frame of
little Louise at the sound of these
words, and she kissed the lips of the
speaker, with strange joy in her eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
&#8220;I cannot stay any longer now,&#8221; said
Rose, attempting to rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go! don&#8217;t go!&#8221; said Louise,
almost wildly, &#8220;I cannot let you go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must, my sweet Louise,&#8221;
said Rose, as she gently disengaged
the child: &#8220;I must go now, but I will
come every day and read to you, and
your &#8216;Daffy,&#8217; out of this dear book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When? When? What time will
you come?&#8221; asked the child, anxiously,
while Daph listened eagerly for the
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomorrow, at eleven o&#8217;clock, you
must stand at the window and watch
for me, I will not keep you waiting
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this promise again repeated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Rose kissed the children, and with a
murmured word of comfort to Daph,
passed from the room.</p>

<p>Not so soon passed away the influence
of that visit prompted by
Christian kindness, rich in blessings to
the humble negro; most precious to
that young disciple of Christ, who had
learned to love to be &#8220;about her
Master&#8217;s business.&#8221;</p>

<span class="font">Strange Proceedings.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Day</span> after day Rose Stuyvesant continued
her ministry of love to Daph
and the little ones. The hour of her
morning visit was watched for, and
hailed with joy, and well it might be,
for she brought with her the sweet influence
of a loving heart and an earnest
devoted spirit.</p>

<p>The children were, as usual, eagerly
looking out for her one morning, about
a week after her first appearance in
their humble home. Daph, who was
once more on her feet, was moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
about with a step a little more languid
than usual, trying, as she said, &#8220;to
make the place look a bit more fitsome
for the sweet young lady to sit down
in.&#8221; Charlie, who was perched on a
chair beside his sister, and had had his
nose pressed from time to time flat
against the window, and had drawn all
sorts of strange characters, with his fat
fingers, in the dampness left by his
breath on the pane, at length had his
attention suddenly arrested. &#8220;O,
Lou!&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;look this way, on
the steps! there&#8217;s that ugly, old, bad
doctor, that cut dear Daffy&#8217;s arm, and
two big men with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good doctor, Charlie!&#8221; said Daph,
&#8220;he wanted to make Daffy well, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
he didn&#8217;t jus know how. It took Miss
Rose wid her sweet holy words to do
Daph good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an old, bad doctor, I say,
and shan&#8217;t come in!&#8221; said Charlie,
springing towards the door, as the
voice of the doctor sounded in the hall,
and his hand touched the latch. The
sturdy little figure of the boy, resolutely
backed up against the door was
but a small obstacle, in the way of the
strong hands that forced it instantly
open.</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame, Mass&#8217; Charlie! Let
the young gemman in!&#8221; said Daph, as
she came forward, dropping a curtsy.
&#8220;Ise quite well sir to day,&#8221; she continued,
&#8220;and Ise mighty tankful for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
you being so uncommon willing to do
somewhat for to cure Daph, for by her
arm do be a little stiff for de cuttin
you gib it de oder day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an old, bad man to hurt
Daffy, and I aint glad to see him a
bit,&#8221; said Charlie, with an angry look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your work! This is the woman!&#8221;
said the slender young doctor,
turning to the stout men he had
brought with him.</p>

<p>A strong hand was laid on each
shoulder of the astonished Daph, and
a rough voice said, &#8220;Come with us,
old woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I isn&#8217;t goin to do no such thing,&#8221;
said she, with an indignant glance.
&#8220;What for is I goin to waste my time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
goin with them as I has no business
wid? Perhaps you doesn&#8217;t know what
manners is, to be layin hands on a
poor nigger dis way. Take your big
hands off! Ise my misses&#8217; childen to
look after, and we&#8217;s would be glad to
hab dis bit of a room to ourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph had not spoken very rapidly,
but even as the indignant words forced
themselves out of her mouth, she was
hurried towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better do your talking
now,&#8221; said one of the men coarsely,
&#8220;for before half an hour&#8217;s over you&#8217;ll
be locked up where nobody&#8217;ll hear you
if you holler till you are hoarse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph began to struggle violently,
and the sinewy men who held her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
were well nigh compelled to relinquish
their grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is you a gemman, doctor?&#8221; she
said desperately, at last, &#8220;Is you a
gemman, and stand still to see a poor
woman treated dis way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are only getting your deserts,&#8221;
said little Dr. Bates, drawing
himself up, and trying to look dignified.
&#8220;You are to be tried for stealing,
and for the other awful crimes which
your own conscience can best count
over to you, and be sure the severest
punishment of the law awaits you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; said Daph, her spirit
rising, &#8220;Carry me to any real gemman,
and it would take more liars
than ever grew to prove any such like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
things against poor Daph. Ise not a
bit afeared to go wid you, for sartain
Ise be back soon &#8217;nough.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children, who had been at first
struck with silent astonishment, now
began to realize that Daph was actually
going from them. Louise burst
into a violent fit of weeping, and clung
to the unfortunate negro, while Charlie,
with an uplifted wash-basin, made
a sudden attack upon the slender legs
of Dr. Bates, which broke up his dignified
composure, and made him give
a skip that would have done honor
to a bear dancing on a hot iron plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mass&#8217; Charley, Ise do be
shamed,&#8221; said Daph, subduing the
grin that had suddenly overspread her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
face. &#8220;De young gemman don&#8217;t
know no better! &#8217;Tain&#8217;t likely he
ever had body to teach him! You
jus let him be, Mass&#8217; Charlie, and tend
to your own sister, Miss Lou, here.
Don&#8217;t cry, pretty dear, Daph will be
back soon! De Lord won&#8217;t let em
hurt Daph! You be jus good childen,
and dat sweet Miss Rose will
comfort you till Daph comes home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last words were hardly uttered,
when the negro was forced into a long
covered wagon and rapidly borne away
from the door.</p>

<p>At this moment Mary Ray ran
breathlessly up the steps, exclaiming,
&#8220;Where have they taken Daph, mother?
Mother, what is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>&#8220;Matter enough!&#8221; said Mrs. Ray,
vehemently; &#8220;who could have told
it would have ended that way! I am
sure I never meant any such thing.
Daph&#8217;s gone to prison; and just as likely
I shall never hear the end of it, and
have the children upon my hands,
into the bargain. Well, well; I wish
I&#8217;d never set eyes on that little spinky,
Dr. Bates!&#8221;</p>

<p>The bitter reproaches that rose to
Mary&#8217;s lips, were hushed at the mention
of the children; and she hastened
to comfort them, as well as she
could, while Mrs. Ray went back to
her kitchen, in no very enviable frame
of mind.</p>

<span class="font">Another Friend.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Dis</span> don&#8217;t be de cleanest place in
de world!&#8221; said Daph to herself, as she
looked round the small, bare room into
which she had been thrust. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
she continued, &#8220;de Lord Jesus, do
be everywhere; and Daph no reason
to be above stayin where such as he
do set foot. But den de childen!
what&#8217;s to become of de childen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Daph&#8217;s resolution gave way,
and she took a hearty cry. &#8220;Daph,
you do be a wicked creter,&#8221; she said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
herself, at length. &#8220;Jus as if de Lord
Jesus didn&#8217;t love little childen ebber
so much better dan you can! He&#8217;s
jus able hisself to take care ob de
dears; and Daph needn&#8217;t go for to
fret hersef bout dem.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus consoled, Daph was prepared
calmly to wait whatever should befall
her. The stream of sunlight that
poured through the small window,
slowly crept along the floor, and the
weary hours passed away.</p>

<p>The new and beautiful truths, that
had of late been brought home to
the soul of Daph, were much in her
thoughts and full of comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do be afraid,&#8221; she said to herself,
&#8220;Ise did not act so bery Christianable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
when dose big men did catch Daph by
de shoulter. Dere&#8217;s somewhat in
Daph mighty strong, dat don&#8217;t like
folks puttin hands on widout tellin
what&#8217;s de matter. Well, well; I
spose Daph will get like a lamb, sometime,
if de Lord helps her. Ise do
wonder what the dears is a doin, jus
now. Maybe that sweet Miss Rose is
just speakin to dem beautiful words
out ob de blessed book. How Daph
would like to hear dose same words,
her own self!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph&#8217;s meditations were interrupted
by the sudden turning of the key in
the lock, and then the door of the
small room was thrown open to admit
the entrance of a stranger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>The new-comer was a short, stout,
elderly man, with a dignified bearing,
and a calm, kindly expression in his
round unfurrowed face.</p>

<p>Daph looked at him from his powdered
head, to his white-topped boots,
with entire satisfaction. &#8220;He do be
a <i>real gemman</i>, and dat &#8217;s a comfort,&#8221;
she said to herself, as she dropped
a curtsy, and waited to be addressed
by the stranger.</p>

<p>Daph&#8217;s favorable impressions were
increased by the mild manner and
clear voice in which she was addressed.
She soon felt sufficiently at ease to
comply with the request made by the
gentleman, that she would tell him,
frankly, all that she could remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of her life for the last few years,
and explain how she, a poor negro,
came in possession of jewelry fit for a
duchess to wear.</p>

<p>Daph began in her own simple way,
and described those pleasant home
scenes on that far Southern island. Her
heart grew light at the thought of the
happy family circle in those good old
times. It was with difficulty she brought
herself to speak of the sudden destruction
with which that home was threatened.
She touched but lightly on her
own efforts to save the little ones,
when there was no earthly friend, but
herself, between them and a bloody
death.</p>

<p>From time to time her listener questioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
her suddenly; but she answered
him with such apparent frankness and
simplicity, that he felt ashamed of the
momentary suspicions that had crossed
his mind.</p>

<p>When Daph came, in the progress of
her story, to the captain&#8217;s late visit, and
to the day of dark, hopeless despair that
followed it, the eyes that were fixed
upon her, slowly filled with tears.</p>

<p>Those tears suddenly gushed forth,
as with the eloquence of a grateful
heart Daph described the face, like
that of an angel, that bent over her
in her distress, and told of the Saviour,
who is the friend of the sinner, and
the comfort of all that mourn.</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless my sweet Rose!&#8221; murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the stranger. &#8220;This was an
errand of mercy, indeed!&#8221; After a
moment&#8217;s pause, he added aloud, &#8220;You
need say no more, Daph;&#8221; and, as he
spoke, he put out his hand to take
that of the humble negro.</p>

<p>She did not notice the movement;
for she had lowered her eyes as she
dropped her modest curtsy, and relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>Diedrich Stuyvesant loved his daughter
Rose, as the apple of his eye; but
he thought her a little too enthusiastic
in her desire to do good; and he
trembled, lest her warm feelings should
lead her judgment astray.</p>

<p>When she had burst into his library
that morning, her face flushed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
excitement and unwonted exercise, he
had met her with more than his usual
calmness and phlegmatic consideration.
The hasty outline she gave him of the
story of her new proteg, seemed to
him strange and improbable; but he
could not resist the earnestness with
which she besought him to hasten
to the release of an innocent and
injured woman. Rose felt a little relieved
when she saw her father take
his gold-headed cane and walk forth,
with the deliberate air of one who has
important business on hand. She
would gladly have hurried his steps;
but she knew, that, though slow and
cautious, whatever he undertook would
be kindly and wisely done, and in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
belief she forced herself to wait patiently
for his long-delayed return.</p>

<p>Good Diedrich Stuyvesant did not
go directly to the prison, as his
daughter had advised. He first called
on Dr. Bates, heard his pompous statement
of the grounds of his suspicions,
and received from him the troublesome
gold chain, that was deemed of such
importance.</p>

<p>Having agreed to meet the little
doctor at a certain hour, at the place
of Daph&#8217;s imprisonment, he proceeded
to the red house with the blue shutters,
and inquired for Mrs. Ray. That
personage was thrown into a fit of
mortification to be found by so grand
a gentleman in a dishabille, plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
intimating its recent proximity to the
wash-tub; and her curiosity alone prevented
her absolutely refusing to be
seen in such a plight.</p>

<p>It did not take Diedrich Stuyvesant
many minutes to fathom Mrs. Ray,
and to give to her mean and idle curiosity
the contempt that even she herself
felt that it deserved. &#8220;All accoutred
as she was,&#8221; she found herself obliged
to accompany her new acquaintance to
the prison, where she and Dr. Bates
occupied a room near that in which
Daph had been placed, while Diedrich
Stuyvesant proceeded to converse with
the prisoner. The time seemed long
to the little doctor; for he had the full
benefit of all the vituperative epithets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
in Mrs. Ray&#8217;s vocabulary, which was
by no means a limited one in that department.
On him she vented all the
dissatisfaction she felt at having been
led &#8220;into,&#8221; as she exclaimed, &#8220;the
worst, the very worst piece of business
I ever put my finger in!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph had completed her story and
was standing silent and humble, when
Diedrich Stuyvesant summoned Dr.
Bates and Mrs. Ray.</p>

<p>The Dr., small in every respect,
entered with an air of triumph, while
Mrs. Ray followed; pity, self-reproach
and curiosity strangely blending in the
expression with which she looked upon
her lodger.</p>

<p>Daph met their glance with quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
composure. In her heart she had
been giving thanks to the merciful
God, who had raised up for her a new
and powerful friend, and fresh from
the presence of her Divine Master, she
could look on those who had injured
her, without one taint of bitterness.</p>

<p>Diedrich Stuyvesant had spoken
often in the councils of his country,
and to his clear, calm voice, none had
failed to listen, for he ever spoke with
the power of reason and truth. Now,
he stood with the dignity of one accustomed
to be heard, as he looked for
a moment in silence on the accusers.
Then, in a short, clear statement, he
told the story of the humble negro,
who listened with wonder, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
named with admiration and respect
the acts which she had performed,
guided by her own loving heart, and
upheld by simple faith in &#8220;the great
Lord&#8221; of all.</p>

<p>Sternness and contempt struggled for
mastery in the voice of Diedrich Stuyvesant,
as in concluding, he turned towards
Dr. Bates, and said, &#8220;As for
you, young man, look at that dark-skinned,
ignorant woman, from whom
you would have lightly taken her only
wealth,&mdash;her good name,&mdash;which is
above all price!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Think of your own fair skin, you
deem so superior,&mdash;of the education
you rightly value,&mdash;the Christian
teaching that has been sounded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
your ears since childhood, and then
say what good work you have done in
this world! What have you to bring
forward in comparison with the heroism
and self-sacrifice of this poor woman,
whom you despised? Young
man, think twice, if you are capable
of thought, before you again peril the
good name of the industrious poor,
who are under the especial care of the
great Father in Heaven! Explore the
secrets of your profession, but honor
the sanctity of every humble home,
and pry not into those things which a
lawful pride and an honorable delicacy
would hide from the eye of a stranger.
Know, young man, that you have this
day broken the laws of this free country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
where no honest citizen can be deprived
of liberty, on bare suspicion,
and you yourself merit the punishment
you would have brought on the guiltless.
But go! I would do you no
harm. Go, and be a wiser and better
man for what you have heard to-day!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Bates, with a crest-fallen air,
turned in haste to leave the room, but
his better feelings prevailed, and stepping
back he said, &#8220;I am young, foolish,
and conceited, I know, sir, and I
hope I have learned a valuable lesson
this day.&#8221; Then, going up to Daph,
he added earnestly, &#8220;I have wronged
you, good woman, and from the bottom
of my heart I am sorry for it. If
it should ever be in my power to serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
you, I should be glad to make amends
for what I have done.&#8221; &#8220;Now don&#8217;t,
sir! don&#8217;t, please!&#8221; said Daph, dropping
curtsy after curtsy, and murmuring,
&#8220;the young gemman meant no
harm, Ise sure,&#8221; while Dr. Bates
slowly left the room. As soon as the
doctor was out of sight, Mrs. Ray took
Daph by the hand, and humbly asked
her forgiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t, Miss&#8217; Ray, I do be
shamed!&#8221; said Daph, in great confusion,
her own tears for the first time beginning
to flow. &#8220;Don&#8217;t speak so to a
poor cretur like me. We&#8217;s all poor sinners;
it&#8217;s only the Lord Jesus,&#8221; sweet
Miss Rose says, &#8220;that can make us
clean.&#8221; The thought of having said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
so much in the presence of a &#8220;real
gentleman&#8221; now overcame Daph, and
she suddenly relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Daph!&#8221; said Diedrich Stuyvesant,
&#8220;it is time for you to be out
of this place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I go free, sir?&#8221; said Daph,
with a wondering, joyous look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Free as air!&#8221; was the reply of Mr.
Stuyvesant; &#8220;there&#8217;s no power in New
York can keep an innocent woman in
such a place as this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph poured forth her thanks to her
deliverer, and Diedrich Stuyvesant
walked forth, followed by the woman.</p>

<p>He was detained but for a moment
in the doorway by the officers, by
whom Daph had been arrested, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
pleaded that no action should be taken
against them for their unwarrantable
proceeding, and were glad to be assured
that their fault, for this once,
would be passed over.</p>

<p>It excited some wonder when the
well-known citizen passed along the
street, closely followed by Mrs. Ray
and Daph; but he cared little for the
remarks of the passers-by, his mind
having been once made up to see Daph
safely restored to the home from which
she had been so rudely taken.</p>

<p>Diedrich Stuyvesant moved at what
was an unwonted pace for him, and the
house with the blue shutters was soon
reached, and the door of the familiar
room thrown open.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>Rose Stuyvesant was sitting on a low
chair, Louise at her side, and Charlie
on her lap; while the book with golden
clasps was open in her hand. With
one shout of joy, the children darted
towards Daph, and gave her a welcome
which filled her honest heart with joy.</p>

<p>That sight was a reward to Diedrich
Stuyvesant for all the unwonted labors
of the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Rose!&#8221; he said, &#8220;they can
do without us now. I must learn to
know these little people some other
day. But stay,&#8221; he added, as he looked
round on the scrupulously neat, but
very plainly furnished apartment,
&#8220;Daph, I must speak to you a moment,
before I go.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>The children for an instant were
quiet, and the wealthy citizen drew his
purse from his pocket, and holding it
towards Daph, he said, &#8220;You ought to
have something to make amends for
this day&#8217;s trouble. Take that for you
and the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ise thank you, sir,&#8221; said Daph,
drawing back, &#8220;Ise thank you, sir, but
my missus&#8217; childen shall want for nothing
while poor old Daph can work
for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, have your own way Daph,&#8221;
said Diedrich Stuyvesant; &#8220;but one
thing you must let me do for you. Let
me take the gold chains that have given
you so much trouble, and put them in
safe keeping. I will see that you get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
their full value in money, if you should
ever be in need.&#8221;</p>

<p>The treasured jewelry was cheerfully
relinquished; and Daph even
felt relieved to have them no longer
in her charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, Daph,&#8221; said the kind-hearted
citizen, as he bade her good-bye,
&#8220;remember, you have something
now to depend upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ise thank you for your goodness,
sir&mdash;Ise thank you. Ise sure the great
Lord will nebber let Daph come to
want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never, Daph! either in this world
or the next!&#8221; said Rose; and with
one of her sweet smiles she followed
her father from the room.</p>

<span class="font">Home Scenes.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days of excitement and distress,
so full of moment to Daph, were succeeded
by a time of comparative quiet
and peace.</p>

<p>Every morning the kind voice of
Rose Stuyvesant, broke in upon the
solitude of Daph and the little ones.
Louise learned to look as eagerly for
the face of Rose as a flower for the
sunlight, and to turn as fondly towards
it. There seemed to be for the
little girl an irresistible charm in the refinement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and guilelessness of her new
friend; and the sweet words of holy
teaching, that ever dropped from the
lips of Rose, had waked to music, a
chord in the child&#8217;s heart, that had
long slumbered in silence. The sensitive
conscience and peculiar interest in
spiritual things, that had marked her
when under her mother&#8217;s influence,
became again evident. As from a
weary dream, she woke to the beauty
and reality of religious truth.</p>

<p>Rose was no sentimental teacher,
contented with exciting mere feeling,
that worked to no good end.</p>

<p>The unselfish devotion and respectful
deference of poor Daph, had fostered
a slight imperiousness in the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Louise; and she had learned to seek
her own comfort, with but too little
regard for the feelings and wishes of
others.</p>

<p>Rose soon saw that her little pet
was in danger of becoming quietly
selfish, and unconsciously proud and
dictatorial.</p>

<p>Tenderly, but faithfully, the young
teacher pointed out to Louise the
germs of those hateful faults, growing
and strengthening in the bad soil of an
evil heart; and the conscience of the
child, made her deeply feel the necessity
of the warning thus affectionately
given.</p>

<p>Bad habits, long indulged, are not
easily overcome, even when the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and best motives govern the conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put on my stockings, this minute,
Daph! You are so slow!&#8221; said Louise,
one morning, putting out her white
foot imperatively towards the kneeling
negro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, Miss Lou,&#8221; said Daph,
humbly, &#8220;Daph do be radder slow;
but somehow she isn&#8217;t so spry as she
used to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was not the only complaint that
Louise had to make that morning;
every thing seemed to go wrong with
her, and Charlie declared, &#8220;Sister
Lou&#8221; was so cross that he had rather
go and play in the garden alone, than
stay anywhere near her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>Daph gave a sorrowful look at her
young mistress, and then went to the
kitchen to prepare some of the tempting
cakes which were now in such
demand, and Louise was left quite
alone.</p>

<p>She took up a piece of sewing on
which Rose had been patiently trying
to teach her to hem; but the thread
&#8220;went in knots,&#8221; the needle pricked
her finger, and she threw the work
down in despair, and began to cry
with all her might.</p>

<p>The door softly opened and a gentle
hand was laid upon her shoulder.
&#8220;What grieves you, darling?&#8221; said
the sweet voice of Rose Stuyvesant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; exclaimed the little girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
not looking up, &#8220;I have been so cross
and naughty all this morning, I do not
believe I am one of the Lord Jesus&#8217;
little lambs, at all, and I am very, very
unhappy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose sat down beside her little
friend, and throwing her arm tenderly
around her, she said, &#8220;You must
not be discouraged, my darling, listen
now to me. Suppose that you were
so very sick, that if you did not soon
get better, you would surely die.
Now, suppose a kind physician should
come to you and offer you some medicine
that would check your fever, and
save you from the death that was so
near. How you would love him, and
how willingly you would do all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
he said was necessary for you. It
might be many, many weeks before
you were quite well; but how patiently
you would take the medicines
he ordered, and how cheerfully you
would follow his advice, until you were
again full of health and strength. And
when you could walk about once more
and breathe the sweet, fresh air, then
you would be most warmly grateful to
the kind physician who had come to
your sick bed, and saved you from
expected death. Dear Louise, Christ
has shed his blood to save you from
everlasting death, which is very near
to all who are not the true children of
God. Whenever you put your trust
in the dear Saviour, you are safe from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
that death; but it may be long, long
before your heart will be clean from
sin, and your bad habits will be wholly
cured. What says the kind physician
to you? &#8216;Watch and pray. Strive to
enter in at the strait gate.&#8217; You
must be willing to struggle, patiently,
against your faults, trying to do right,
and looking to God for strength to go
on. You must go forward cheerfully
and hopefully, thinking of what Christ
has done for you, and dwelling on that
happy time when you will be safe
in Heaven, and your heart will be full
of gratitude to Him who has saved
your soul from death, and purified you
by His grace. Do you understand me,
darling?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; sobbed little Louise,
&#8220;and indeed I will try&mdash;try harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you begin to-day,&#8221; said
Rose, &#8220;to see if you cannot do something
for others; that is the best cure
for selfishness. Here, I have brought
an apron for Daph, which I want you
to make. It will please her to think
you have done it for her. She is so
kind to you, that you should try to
make her happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Louise had always accepted Daph&#8217;s
services as a matter of course, and it
dawned upon her as a new idea that she
was to try to make happy the humble
creature who never seemed to have a
wish but to serve her master&#8217;s children
faithfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>Little by little, Louise began to take
hold of the idea that to be Christ-like
is to be useful, fond of making others
happy, and forgetful of self.</p>

<p>Daph resisted stoutly when Louise
first proposed to dress herself, and began
by degrees to take some care of
Charlie. &#8220;But,&#8221; thought the poor
negro, &#8220;Daph may die some day, and
the sweet little mistress do be right;
she must learn to help herself a little,
for nobody knows what may happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here Daffy, I have made this for
you all myself!&#8221; said Louise, joyfully,
as she held up the apron, which after
many days of secret toil she had completed.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Daph, Miss Lou! and all made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
with those dear little hands. Now
Daph do feel proud!&#8221; and tears filled
the eyes of the honest creature.</p>

<p>It was not the mere gift that made
the heart of the negro throb with pleasure;
but it was the kind consideration,
the patient thought for her welfare
that overcame her, as she said,
&#8220;You do be like dear missus now!
Dat&#8217;s de way she used to speak to poor
Daph.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Daffy,&#8221; said Louise, bursting
into tears, &#8220;I do not mean to be ever
naughty to you again. Indeed, I am
very, very sorry. I am going to be
one of the Lord Jesus&#8217; little children
now, and you know he was always kind
and gentle.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>&#8220;Now de great Lord be praised!&#8221;
said Daph, as she sank down quite
overcome. &#8220;Daph do be too full of
joy, to hear dose words from her own
little dear. De Lord help her, and
bring her to his beautiful home!&#8221;</p>

<p>To be able to read her mother&#8217;s Bible
now became the dearest wish of the
little Louise, and with this strong motive
she made rapid progress in the
daily lessons she took from her kind
friend Rose. The patience and perseverance
of both teacher and scholar
were at length rewarded. Louise was
able, after a few months of careful instruction,
to take her mother&#8217;s Bible,
and, in her sweet, childlike way, read
the words of truth and beauty that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
flowed from the lips of Him who
&#8220;spake as never man spake.&#8221;</p>

<p>The leaves, brightened by early
frosts, still fluttered on the trees, and
the soft air of Indian summer floated
in at the open windows. A lovely autumn
day was drawing to a close.
Daph and her little charge had taken
their simple evening meal, and for a
moment there was silence in the cheerful
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daffy,&#8221; said Louise, &#8220;I will read
to you now out of the dear book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph sat down reverently on her
low bench, and Charlie, in imitation,
quietly took his own little chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
not want,&#8221; read the subdued voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the child, while the negro bent forward
to catch each word of the beautiful
psalm.</p>

<p>&#8220;She do be one of the great shepherd&#8217;s
lambs, sure &#8217;nough,&#8221; murmured
Daph, as the little girl closed the book
and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Daffy, we&#8217;ll sing a hymn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Charlie joined his voice with
that of his earnest sister, and poor
Daph, &#8217;mid fast flowing tears, added
her notes of praise to that evening
hymn. Joy and peace that evening
pervaded those few hearts in that humble
room, for it was bright with His
presence who has said, &#8220;Where two or
three are gathered together in my
name, there am I in the midst of
them.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII.<br />

<span class="font">Mary Ray.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was midnight. Charlie and Louise
were locked in the sound sleep of youth
and vigorous health; but Daph, with
the half-wakefulness of a faithful dog,
was not so dead to the outer world.</p>

<p>A slight knock, and then a stealthy
footstep, roused the negro, and she
started up and looked about her. In
the dim moonlight she saw Mary Ray
standing at her bedside, with her finger
on her lips, and herself setting the example
in every motionless limb, of the
silence she imposed.</p>

<p>Mary took Daph by the hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
led her into the hall, and then said in
a whisper,</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not go without bidding you
good-bye, you have always been so
kind to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daph looked in wonder at the slender
young girl, wrapped in her shawl,
and carrying a small bundle in her
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is you going, Mary?&#8221; she
said, anxiously; &#8220;it&#8217;s no good is takin&#8217;
you from home at this time of night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can bear it no longer,&#8221; said
Mary, with quiet determination; &#8220;I
have never had a home, and now I am
going to look for one for myself.
Mother may find out that, if I am &#8216;only
a girl,&#8217; she will miss me. Good-bye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Daph. I should like to kiss the children
once more, but I am afraid I
should wake them. Good-bye!&#8221; and
the young girl shook the hand of her
humble friend.</p>

<p>The hand she had given was not so
easily released; it was held gently but
firmly as if in a vice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ise wont let you go&mdash;go straight to
black sin,&#8221; said Daph, earnestly; &#8220;you&#8217;s
a leavin&#8217; the mother the great Lord gave
you; you&#8217;s a leavin&#8217; the home the great
Lord put you in, and there&#8217;s black sin
a waitin&#8217; outside for you, if you go so
young and lone; Ise will not let you go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot bear it any longer,&#8221; said
Mary, and she sank down on the floor,
and wiped away her fast-flowing tears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>Mary had of late had a hard life, indeed.
Mrs. Ray had been slowly coming
to a knowledge of herself, and this
knowledge, instead of bringing repentance
and reformation, had made her
doubly unreasonable and irritable, and
on Mary she had vented all her ill-humor.</p>

<p>Though still treated as a child, Mary
had become, in feeling and strength
of character, a woman. The sense of
injustice and ill-treatment, which had
grown with her growth, had now reached
its height. The down-trodden child,
now felt herself a curbed, thwarted,
almost persecuted woman, and she was
determined to bear her present life no
longer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>It was in vain that Daph plead with
her to give up her wild purpose; at last
all the poor negro&#8217;s store of persuasion
and warning was exhausted, and in her
despair, she said desperately, &#8220;Now
you Mary jus sit still here, and let Daph
tell you somewhat dat do be all solemn
true, ebery single word.&#8221; Daph
had been no inattentive listener to
Rose&#8217;s frequent reading of the Saviour&#8217;s
life on earth; and now, in her own
simple, graphic language, she sketched
the outline of his patient suffering, and
painful, unresisted death. She told of
the glory of His heaven, where those
who humbly follow Him, shall rejoice
forever; and the speaker and the listener
forgot the dreary place and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
midnight hour, as she dwelt in faith
on that glorious theme. &#8220;Dere&#8217;ll be
nobody dere, Mary, dat turns de back
on de work de Lord gibs em to do!&#8221;
said Daph, earnestly. &#8220;Stay, Mary,
and try to bear for de Lord Jesus&#8217;
sake! Who knows but your poor ma,
her own self, may learn to know bout
de heavenly home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every human heart has its trials,
which it can only bear in the strength
that God alone can give. Every
human heart feels the need of comfort
and hope, which can only be found
in God&#8217;s truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Ray was touched by the simple
eloquence of her humble friend,
and acted upon by the glorious motives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
held out to her for new efforts of
forbearance and patient endurance.</p>

<p>The world she had known was
dreary and dismal enough; but what
terrors, trials, and temptations might
not await her in the new scenes into
which she was hastily rushing. Subdued
and softened, she crept back to
her bed, and lay down beside the
mother whom she had so nearly forsaken.
Compared with the wide, lone
world without, that poor, low room
seemed a kindly and comfortable shelter;
and as her mother sighed and
groaned in her sleep, Mary felt that
natural affection was not yet dead in
her heart&mdash;that a tie bound her to her
on whose bosom she had been nursed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>True prayer was at that moment
going up to heaven for the poor, tried,
desperate girl. And what faithful petition
was ever unnoticed or unanswered!</p>

<p>Mary met Daph&#8217;s kind &#8220;good morning,&#8221;
with a shy, averted face, and
kept out of her way as much as possible
during the day.</p>

<p>When evening came on and the
sound of singing was heard in the room
of the lodgers. Mary lingered at the
open door, and did not resist when
Daph noiselessly stepped to her side
and drew her to the low bench where
she herself was seated.</p>

<p>Mary Ray learned to love that evening
hour when she could hear Louise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
read of the blessed Saviour, and join
her voice in the hymns of praise, that
went up from the faithful worshippers.</p>

<p>Even this pleasure she was soon
obliged to deny herself; for all her
time and attention were needed beside
the sick bed of her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray had never wholly recovered
from the severe cold with which
she had been attacked soon after the
arrival of Daph. At times, her cough
returned upon her with violence, and
at length a sudden hemorrhage laid
her low. Prostrate, enfeebled and
helpless, Mrs. Ray had time to dwell
upon her past life, and see all too
plainly, the hatefulness of her own
wicked heart. A dull despair crept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
over her. She gave herself up as a
lost and hopeless being, waiting for
her eternal doom. Daph felt her own
incapacity to reason with, and comfort
the wretched woman, and to Rose she
turned for aid and counsel.</p>

<p>Often and long Rose Stuyvesant sat
beside the bed of the unhappy woman,
and strove to open her mind to the
free forgiveness, granted through the
blood of Christ Jesus. Her words of
peace seemed to fall on a deaf ear and
a deadened heart; but to the listening,
unnoticed Mary, they were the
message of pardon and joy in believing.</p>

<p>Long years of humbling sickness
were in store for Mrs. Ray, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
which she was to be dependent for
care and sustenance upon the child
she had undervalued and ill-treated.
From that child to whom she had
given life, she was to receive the still
greater blessing of being gently led
towards the life eternal.</p>

<p>Mary&#8217;s days and nights of watching,
and words of holy comfort, fell like
the noiseless dew on the heart of the
mother, till at last, remorse was exchanged
for repentance, and the cold
alienation of a sinful heart, for the
loving trust of one, forgiven through
the &#8220;Only Mediator.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Daph went cheerfully
and industriously on, providing for the
physical wants of the children so dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
to her; while Rose, with almost a
mother&#8217;s love, led them in the way of
truth and moulded them by her sweet
influence. Little by little she managed
to throw an air of refinement about
the humble room where they dwelt,
and to add many comforts and luxuries
to their hitherto simple way of life.
She advised Daph as to their plain but
tasteful style of dress, and gave to their
manners that nameless charm of delicacy
and true politeness, which Daph
felt herself so unable to describe, or
impart.</p>

<p>While Louise grew tall, graceful and
attractive, and Charlie&#8217;s ruddy face
was bright with frank cheerfulness,
Rose fancied that Daph&#8217;s step waxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
feeble, and her figure less straight than
in the first days of their acquaintance.</p>

<p>When Rose expressed anxiety about
the health of the poor negro, to whom
she was really strongly attached,
Daph would answer with a smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Daph do be a bit older, Miss Rose;
but nebber you fret for her. De great
Lord wont take her away yet, she
most sure. Nebber you mind Daph;
she do be well enough&mdash;and oh, so
happy!&#8221;</p>

<p>The upward glance of the eye of
honest Daph, told of the source of her
happiness, and the spring of her faithful,
conscientious life.</p>

<span class="font">The Basket Overturned.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Good-bye</span>, dears!&#8221; said Daph, as
she went forth as usual one morning,
with her basket on her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Daffy, dear Daffy!&#8221; said
the young voices, and she was gone.</p>

<p>Those sweet sounds lingered in the
ear of the negro, as she walked along
the crowded street, unconscious of all
around her, and lost in meditation on
the many mercies of her lot.</p>

<p>The passers-by noticed her frank,
good face, her tidy figure, and snow-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
apron; but she seemed to see no
one, until, as if struck with sudden
frenzy, she gave one leap into the air,
exclaiming,</p>

<p>&#8220;Is I in a blessed dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>The neat cover flew from the passing
basket; far and wide rolled the
frosted cakes, and little ragged children
made merry with the stores of
Daph&#8217;s cookery. Little did she care.
Her arms were thrown round the knees
of an astonished lady, and her lips
kissed the hand of the tall, pale gentleman
at the lady&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull off the crazy woman!&#8221; shouted
a bystander, stepping forward to
suit the action to the word; but Daph
had found a protector, in the confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of whose kindness she would
have faced the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;My own missus! my massa!&#8221; sobbed
the poor negro, as she clung to the
loved and long-mourned friends who
stood before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it you, Daph!&#8221; they said, as, little
less moved than herself, they raised
her from her humble position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ise got &#8217;em! Ise got &#8217;em!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;De childen! Dey&#8217;s safe!
Ise got &#8217;em! De Lord be praised!&#8221;</p>

<p>Who can tell the throb of joy that
shook that mother&#8217;s heart, or the deep
emotion that filled the eyes of the
strong man with gushing tears!</p>

<p>They needed not to tell Daph to
lead the way to their treasures. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
she sped through street and lane, followed
by hurrying footsteps and beating
hearts.</p>

<p>The small house with the blue shutters
was reached, the threshold was
crossed! A moment the mother paused,
as if to gather strength for the
meeting, and then the door was thrown
open.</p>

<p>In that simple, neat room, sat the
fair Louise, her bit of sewing in her
hand, while beside her Charlie bent
over the book he was reading aloud to
his sister.</p>

<p>The wondering children were clasped
in their mother&#8217;s arms, and received
their father&#8217;s loving embrace; while
Daph, almost wild with joy, kept repeating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
&#8220;You&#8217;s no more lone orphans,
with only poor old Daph to mind you!
De Lord be praised! Daph&#8217;s work is
done. She be ready to go now, when
it pleases de Lord Jesus!&#8221;</p>

<p>How those parents rejoiced to have
their lost ones restored, sound in
health, and bearing every evidence of
having been trained to habits of neatness,
and nurtured in delicacy and refinement!
This was joy, indeed; but
who shall describe the gladness of the
mother when she found her children
speaking of the Saviour as a familiar
friend, and bearing, however faintly,
his image in their hearts! Such joy
angels know, when they welcome at
the gate of heaven the weary pilgrim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of earth, and usher him into the
eternal home of the Father!</p>

<p>Daph listened with wondering eyes
and grateful heart to the story of their
escape, whom she had so long mourned,
and whose place she had so striven to
fill.</p>

<p>The coachman, who was pledged to
murder his master and mistress, relented,
and resolved to save them from the
ruin with which they were threatened.</p>

<p>Gen. Latourette&#8217;s first suspicion of
danger was roused by finding that they
had been driven in the wrong direction,
while he in careless confidence
had been chatting with his wife. In
the moonlight, he could see the flashing
of the waves and hear the murmur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
of the waters, and jet he knew he was
not near his home, but at some less
familiar part of the coast.</p>

<p>Calling out hastily to the coachman,
the carriage came to a stand; General
Latourette became aware that the
horses had been cut loose, and he saw
the fellow, pistol in hand, seated upon
one of them.</p>

<p>In a few hurried words the negro
told the danger of the moment, and
pointed to a boat at the water-side,
which offered to his master and mistress
some hope of escape.</p>

<p>Did Mrs. Latourette forget her little
ones in that hour of peril? No! She
pleaded to go to them, if but to mingle
her blood with theirs. The negro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
assured her they were already sleeping
the sleep of death, and implored her
to fly with her husband, while yet their
lives might be saved.</p>

<p>Thus urged, they entered the little
boat, and while the strong arm of the
husband sustained the drooping wife,
and guided the little skiff over the
dark waters, the negro went his way,
to show the contents of the rifled
trunks as proofs of the crime he had in
reality shrunk from committing.</p>

<p>Gen. Latourette and his wife reached
a neighboring island in safety; but
exiled forever from their own dear
home.</p>

<p>Sorrowful, as the childless only can
be, the world seemed to them suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
robbed of its brightness; they could
not have borne the trials of their lot,
but for the sustaining hand of the Father
in Heaven, in whom they had in
the days of their prosperity learned to
trust.</p>

<p>Several years of foreign travel had
in a measure recruited the failing health
of Gen. Latourette, and time had calmed
the poignant grief of his wife. They
had come to New York, hoping once
more to have a home of their own, sorrowful
though that home must be.</p>

<p>Bereaved and childless no more, with
deep thankfulness they praised the God
of Heaven for his most unexpected
mercies, and devoted themselves anew
to His service.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>As for Daph, their gratitude to her
knew no bounds, and they felt that, for
her faithful services, they could find no
adequate reward on earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Latourette</span> and his wife had
once more a home of their own, made
bright by the smiles of their affectionate
children.</p>

<p>At that home Rose Stuyvesant was
received as a loved friend, and made a
sharer in the pure joy she had assisted
in laying up for the happy parents.
There Diedrich Stuyvesant had been
welcomed as an honored guest, and
there Captain Jones had seen, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
united family, something which gave
his kind heart more joy than did the
warm expressions of gratitude that
were lavished upon him, or the more
substantial favors that were bestowed
with no stinted hand on the honest
sailor. Even Mary Ray and her invalid
suffering mother experienced the
cheering influence that flowed from
that happy home, and felt that, although
their lodgers were gone, they
had in them still warm and powerful
friends. In the midst of this grateful
rejoicing was Daph forgotten? No!
Among the loved and honored, she was
best loved and most cared for. In the
neat room assigned to her was clustered
every comfort that could smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
the declining years or cheer the humble
spirit of the faithful negro. She prized
each token of loving remembrance that
made that room beautiful in her eyes;
but dearest to her was the Bible with
the golden clasps, which lay on her
table, placed there by her mistress,
with words which filled the heart of
Daph with tearful joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Daph this morning?&#8221;
asked Gen. Latourette at the breakfast
table; &#8220;I did not see her dear old
face in the hall, as I came down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is not awake yet,&#8221; said the
wife; &#8220;I told the children they must
not rouse her. She must take her
rest; her days of labor are over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God grant that our work may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
as well done!&#8221; said the father, solemnly.</p>

<p>Later in the day, the children could
not be kept from &#8220;just looking at dear
Daffy, even if she were asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>The family party entered the quiet
room.</p>

<p>The sunbeams shone across the floor
with cheerful light; but they were
dark to the gaze of Daph, for she was
beholding the unveiled glory of the
Sun of Righteousness. The voice of
earthly affection could wake her no
more, for she had listened to the welcome
of angels, and heard the voice
of her Saviour declare, &#8220;Well done,
thou good and faithful servant, enter
thou into the joy of thy Lord!&#8221;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
